On November 23, Information Technology (IT) MinisterAshwini Vaishnawwill chair a meeting with them, and a day later, on November 24, Minister of State for IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar will discuss the issue with the platforms. During the meetings, the government is expected to share a standard operating procedure with the companies on how they should deal with deepfakes on their platforms. Executives from Meta andGoogleare expected to attend. Last Friday, Prime MinisterNarendra Modisaid it’s important to understand how artificial intelligence (AI) works as it could be used to create deepfakes to purposefully spread false information or have malicious intent behind their use. A deepfake is a video of a person in which the face or body has been digitally altered so that he or she appears to be someone else, typically used to spread false information. Mostly, a controversy erupted after a video of actress Rashmika Mandanna entering an elevator went viral on social media. What initially appeared genuine was, in fact, a deepfake of the actress. The original video featured a British Indian person, and their face was morphed to insert Mandanna’s face instead. Not only this, there has been a surge of deepfake audios and videos of political leaders on platforms like Instagram. “In the next three-four days, we will have a meeting with all platforms. We will brainstorm on that (deepfake), and make sure that platforms make adequate efforts for preventing, avoiding, cleaning up their platforms,” Vaishnaw said on November 18. Earlier this month, the IT Ministry had also sent advisories to social media platforms, includingFacebook, Instagram and YouTube, to take down deepfakes. The advisory had reiterated existing legal provisions that platforms have to follow as online intermediaries. It has mentioned Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, which entails punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resources with imprisonment up to three years and fine up to Rs 1 lakh. The advisory also mentioned Rule 3(2)(b) of the Information Technology Rules, under which social media platforms are required to take down content in the nature of impersonation, including artificially morphed images of an individual.',\n",
              "       'IPEF supply chain pact won’t impact policy space to impose export curbs: OfficialThe supply chain resilience agreement of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) will not curb New Delhi’s policy space to impose export restrictions, a government official said on Tuesday. Additional Secretary at the commerce ministry, Rajesh Agarwal clarified that the agreement mentioned imposing “unnecessary” export restrictions, but it is caveated and is similar to the World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions and not beyond that. If a country imposes any export curb without giving any justification, that is treated as unnecessary, he clarified. Use of export restrictions assumes significance as India has extensively used measures to ensure food security and arrest food prices in the run up to the general elections. “Under the supply chain agreement, there is nothing where in our policy space to exercise our rights of change in tariffs or change in export policy…whatever is necessary for the country’s food security or any other requirement of the country also, that policy space remains with us,” Agarwal said. According to him, India will not have to provide any kind of advance information to IPEF members about doing any change in customs duties. IPEF was launched jointly by the United States and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 last year largely to counter China’s influence on trade. The framework is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except trade. Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam are members of the bloc.',\n",

G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant, while speaking at a curtain raiser briefing for the Virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit Tuesday, said development will be the core agenda, while leaders may discuss many other issues. “Since our successful hosting of the G20 Leaders’ Summit on September 9-10 and the unanimous adoption of the NewDelhiLeaders’ Declaration, the world has actually witnessed a succession of events and several new challenges have emerged. While development will be the core agenda and we will focus on the development issue, the leaders may discuss many other issues and the virtual summit will provide an opportunity not only to discuss the implementation of the Leaders’ Declaration but also for leaders to share views and enhance cooperation on critical challenges that we confront and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm our existing commitments towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives,” he said. When asked if the Israel-Hamas conflict will be discussed, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said he “didn’t want to prejudge what issues would be raised by the leaders”. He also said that the Summit’s attendance is not expected to be any different in terms of participation seen at the New Delhi Leaders’ Summit held in September. Certain Russian media reports stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the virtual G20 Summit, who had skipped the previous G20 Leaders’ Summit in September. As the New Delhi Summit had drawn to a close in September, Prime MinisterNarendra Modihad proposed a virtual session in November before the end of India’s presidency – Brazil will take over the G20 presidency from December 1. Accelerating Progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a push towards reforming multilateral development banks (MDBs), addressing debt vulnerabilities, climate finance, and the use of digital public infrastructure for financial inclusion were among the key features in the declaration from the G20 Leaders’ Summit summit. As per the 2023 G20 New Delhi Update released on November 13 that reviewed 34 ongoing G20 development commitments — two are assessed as being “completed”, 31 are assessed as being “on track”, and one commitment recorded as “no update received”. The completed ones included G20 support forCovid-19response and recovery in developing countries, known as the ‘Pandemic Fund’ along with the initiative for rural youth employment in developing countries.',\n",

              "       'Govt, RBI on ‘high alert’ on inflation; rate hike transmission may temper demand: Finance MinistryEven as “inflationary pressures” have moderated, there are persistent downside risks to growth and macroeconomic stability from inflation which continues to keep the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on “high alert”, Ministry of Finance said in its latest monthly economic review for October 2023. The Ministry also said that a fuller transmission of the monetary policy, which essentially means pass-through of the central bank’s rate hikes to consumers by banks, may also temper domestic demand. “With more than half of the current financial year witnessing positive developments in the economy, the full financial year should conclude as projected with a strong growth performance and macroeconomic stability. Yet risks on the downside persist.Inflationis one of them that has kept both the government and the RBI on high alert. Financial flows in the external sector also need constant monitoring as they impact the value of rupee and the balance of payments. A fuller transmission of the monetary policy may also temper domestic demand,” the report said. Headlineretail inflationhad slipped to a four-month low of 4.87 per cent in October. However, inflation concerns continue to persist. Last week, RBI in its monthly bulletin had said that while festival demand remains “ebullient” and consumer sentiment is “upbeat”, India has “miles to go” and is “not out of the woods yet” on inflation. Also, the Ministry pointed out that transmission of the monetary policy tightening “may be beginning to take effect”, which may impact domestic demand. “Against a cumulative hike of 250 basis points (bps) in policyrepo rate, lending rates have increased by 187 bps in respect of fresh loans and 105 bps in respect of outstanding loans,” it said. At the same time, the Ministry said the festive season has “further strengthened consumption demand”. “While accumulated savings and declining rates of unemployment constitute the underlying strength of consumption demand, the wealth effect emanating from rising real estate prices and growing capitalisation of equity markets may have also strengthened consumption,” it said. The Ministry also emphasised that the central government is on track to achieve the budgeted fiscal deficit target for the current financial year supported by buoyancy in revenue mop-up and prudent expenditure management. “Continued buoyancy in revenue collections supported by prudent expenditure management has enabled the fiscal deficit to be contained within 40 per cent of the Budget Estimate during the first half of the year. The government’s emphasis on capital expenditure has continued during the year as well, imparting an impetus to private investment. The recent steep and rapid decline in global crude oil prices removes an important source of potential impact on public finances as well,” it said. On the growth front, the ministry said India’s growth experience in 2023-24 should continue to be a positive outlier as compared to other major economies. “The government’s sustained investment push, healthy corporate profits, and a reduction in bank non-performing loans will likely keep investment buoyant despite elevated input costs. India’s exports are also expected to perform well, driven by strong performance in services exports,” it said.',\n",

The statement came against the backdrop of reports saying that the airline was not willing to fly the passengers and deboarded them from the plane. On Sunday (November 19), IndiGo operated flight 6E 478 from Amritsar toChennaivia Bengaluru with eight transit passengers on board. “Due to the delay of the incoming aircraft from Amritsar, these passengers were unable to board the onward flight to Chennai at the Bengaluru airport.

              "       'Govt cancels bid for appointing asset valuer for IDBI Bank, fresh RFP to be issuedThe government on Tuesday cancelled the bid process for the appointment of an asset valuer for strategic sale-bound IDBI Bank on low bidder interest. A fresh Request For Proposal (RFP) would be invited soon after a review of some of the bid criteria to enable better interest from bidders. “It has been decided with the approval of the competent authority to cancel the present RFP and to issue a fresh RFP for selection of an asset valuer for strategic disinvestment of IDBI Bank Ltd,” DIPAM said in a corrigendum. “We had only a single bid. A fresh RFP will be issued soon after we review some of the criteria to enable better interest from bidders,” a government official said. The government, along with LIC, is selling nearly 61 per cent stake in IDBI Bank and in January received multiple Expressions of Interest (EoIs) for the same. Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had last week said the IDBI Bank strategic sale transaction is “on course” but the transaction would not be completed in the current fiscal. “We practically don’t think that before March we can conclude it (IDBI Bank stake sale),” Pandey had said. As part of the strategic sale process, on September 1, DIPAM invited bids for appointing an asset valuer and the last date for submission of bids was October 9. The deadline was later extended till October 30. The asset valuer was mandated to identify intangibles not on the IDBI Bank balance sheet, like brand name, branch network and value them. The terms of reference for asset valuers included describing and listing of all the properties and assets, including intangibles such as trademark(s), title to property rights being valued, as provided by the bank. Valuation of intangibles were required to be indicated separately. The DIPAM had earlier said the bank has 120 properties in the top seven cities. These include 68 properties inMumbai, 20 inPune, nine inChennaiand seven inAhmedabad. Besides, it has six properties inKolkataand five each inDelhiandHyderabad. The asset properties in the seven cities account for 94 per cent of the total written down value (after accounting for depreciation) of fixed assets of IDBI Bank. The government and LIC together hold 94.72 per cent stake in IDBI Bank. Pursuant to the strategic sale transaction, the government will own 15 per cent stake and LIC 19 per cent shareholding in IDBI Bank, taking their total holding to 34 per cent.',\n",

The deadline to submit takeover bids ends on Tuesday, and the sources told Reuters Jindal had decided against bidding after evaluating the airline’s financial statements. While the deadline can be extended via an application to the courts, creditors are currently not inclined to do so, two banking sources said. “The EoI was largely to check the valuation of the airline and get access to the company’s data,” said one of the sources. “After evaluation, the company has decided not to put in a bid.” The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Jindal Power and Go First’s resolution professional did not reply to emails seeking comment. Go First filed for voluntary insolvency in May and owes a total of 65.21 billion rupees ($785.6 million) to its creditors. Bankers had pinned their hopes on Jindal’s interest, said a banker at a lender that has exposure to Go First.“But it looks like that hasn’t materialised,” the banker added, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. The Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank and Deutsche Bank are among the top creditors to the airline.The Committee of Creditors will meet on Wednesday to decide the future course of action, said another banker. He also declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Both bankers said the liquidation of the airline was now the most likely option as there were no serious bidders.Banks are already evaluating a property that is held as collateral with lenders in case of liquidation, one of the bankers said. Go First is currently locked in a legal tussle with its lessors after they were blocked from repossessing planes due to a moratorium imposed by Indian courts. A recent amendment to India’s insolvency rules allows lessors to take back the planes, but a court has yet to determine whether this change can be applied retrospectively to Go First.',\n",

              "       'SEBI chief urges investors to take long-term view of markets to beat inflation rateSEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Monday urged investors to invest on a long-term basis as it would help in wealth creation, beat inflation and provide real rate of returns. Referring to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent study, which showed that around 89 per cent of the individual traders in the equity Futures and options (F&O) segment incurred losses with an average loss of Rs 1.1 lakh during FY 2021-2022 (FY22), Buch said she was confused and surprised as to why people continue to trade in the segment knowing that the odds are not in their favour at all. “There is a 90 per cent chance that the investor will lose money in the F&O segment. But we also know and the data shows us that, if you take a long-term view of the market and if you invest with a long term perspective, you will rarely go wrong,” she said at the launch of an Investor Risk Reduction Access (IRRA) platform. F&O are derivative instruments where traders buy an underlying asset (share) at a predetermined price. SEBI’s study, released in January this year, stated that 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), on an average, loss makers registered net trading loss close to Rs 50,000 in FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), the average loss of a loss maker was over 15 times the average profit by a profit maker during FY22, the study showed. Buch said the real power lies in the hands of the investors if they take a longer-term view on their investments. If investors take a long-term view, there is really a good chance that they would be creating wealth for themselves and their family over a sustained period of time that would “exceed theinflationrate in the economy”, and therefore, they would actually get “real rate of return on their investments over the long-term”, she said. At the end of September 2023, 3.35 crore demat accounts were registered with National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and 9.62 crore with Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL), as per the SEBI’s October bulletin. IRRA platform, which was launched by Buch, is conceptualised and implemented by market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) under the guidance of SEBI to reduce risks faced by investors in the eventuality of technical glitch at trading member end at both primary site and disaster recovery site. It provides investors an opportunity to square off or cancel their pending orders in case of a disruption of trading services provided by trading members. Buch said the IRRA platform is a safety net that will help people to invest with confidence.“The hope is that this is a system that we will never need to use. It’s like a safety net which is there for a trapeze artist…he hopes to never use that safety net but it really needs to be there,” she said. IRRA can be invoked by trading members when they are faced with a technical glitch at their end impacting their ability to service clients across exchanges from both – primary site and disaster recovery site, where relevant. On invocation, after basic checks, the platform downloads trades of trading members from all the trading venues and sends SMS/email to investors using internet trading or wireless technology along with a link to access IRRA. Investors using this link can review the status of their investment, orders etc, and place orders for squaring off or closing positions. Speaking on the upstreaming of clients funds by stock brokers (SBs)/ clearing members (CMs) to clearing corporations (CCs), the chairperson said though it was implemented, the regulator has received feedback about difficulty in complying with the guidelines. As per the framework, SBs/CMs cannot retain clients’ funds on an end of day (EoD) basis. The clients’ funds has to be upstreamed by SB/ CMs to CCs only in the form of either cash, lien on fixed deposit receipts (FDR), or pledge of units of Mutual Fund Overnight Schemes (MFOS). Buch said the regulator, after taking feedback from brokers, will be soon issuing a new notification on the upstreaming of funds. “The operational challenges that were faced by our brokers in terms of the upstreaming circular are now pretty much resolved, and hopefully we should have a notification which now simplifies everybody’s life quite considerably,” she said.',\n",
              "       'Religare board rallies around Rashmi Saluja, defends her share salesThe board of directors of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL), which is engaged in a battle for control with the Burmans of the Dabur group, has come out in support of its Executive Chairperson Rashmi Saluja, stating she had turned around the financial services company. “The accusations are not only against Rashmi in isolation but targeted toward the entire management and the board that has worked tirelessly and with dedication and commitment to make Religare a debt free organization over five years,” REL board said in a statement, defending the share sale and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOPs) of Saluja. There are five non-executive independent directors on the REL board, according to the BSE. They are: Malay Kumar Sinha, Hamid Ahmed, Praveen Kumar Tripathi, Ranjan Dwivedi and Preeti Madan. The Burmans, who have made an open offer to take control of REL, have levelled a series of allegations against the REL Chairperson and the company. The board of the financial services company said “a historic revival” and “one time settlement” of RFL was completed through organic collections and payments of more than Rs 9,000 crore made to the country’s banking system. “As result of the overall growth of all businesses, the company’s market cap has remarkably increased to about a billion dollars from a low of under $100 million in March 2018,” the board said. Clarifying the current allegations, the board said, “sale of REL shares by Executive Chairperson categorically denies the fact that the representative of the Burman family informed her of the proposed open offer during the said meeting on September 20, 2023. The said sale of shares by Saluja liquidating her ESOPs was along with 12 other employees of REL.” “This process of liquidation of ESOPs through financing and sale was set in motion several days before the said meeting that happened on September 20, 2023. The actual sale of shares that happened on September 21 and 22, 2023 was made at the prevalent market price,” the statement said. The board said the Care Health Insurance ESOPs were granted to Rashmi Saluja only in her capacity as employee/Executive Director and Chairperson of REL. The ESOPs were not to be granted to her in her capacity as Non-Executive Chairperson of Care Health Insurance Limited. “The above issuance of ESOPs to EC has been in full conformity with the guidelines of the Insurance Regulator applicable to insurance companies,” it said. “The remuneration of Saluja has been performance-linked and has been approved by theNRC, the Board and the Shareholders of REL. Any change in the above needs approval from the shareholders, which has been obtained with an overwhelming majority each time as required,” it said. Saluja was reappointed as the Executive Chairperson in February 2023, for a second term, for a five-year period, through a resolution by the board and approval of shareholders. As per the Annual Report for FY 22-23 of REL, the remuneration for the Executive Chairperson was Rs 8.12 crore… even after including the perquisites value of the ESOPs, it reached a figure of Rs 42.06 crore, the statement said. REL shares rose 5.64 per cent to Rs 229.50 on the BSE on Monday.',\n",
              "       'RBI’s tightening of lending norms for unsecured loans is credit positive, says Moody’sThe Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) recent move to tighten the risk weights on unsecured personal loans and credit cards by banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) is credit positive because lenders will need to allocate higher capitals, which will improve their loss-absorbing buffers, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on Monday. Last week, the RBI increased the risk weights on the exposure of banks towards consumer credit, credit card receivables and NBFCs by 25 per cent up to 150 per cent. “The tightening of underwriting norms through higher risk-weighted assets is credit positive because lenders will need to allocate higher capitals for such loans improving their loss-absorbing buffers and may dampen their growth appetite,” Moody’s Investors Services said. Risk weight refers to the capital banks keep aside as provisioning to cover any loan defaults. As per State Bank of India’s (SBI) Group Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the banking industry will require Rs 84,000 crore of excess capital or five per cent increase on Rs 15.2 lakh crore capital requirement following the rise in risk weights on these unsecured personal loans. This means a 55-60 basis point increase in CRAR (Capital to risk weighted assets ratio) due to these regulatory measures. The report said that the unsecured segment has been growing very rapidly in the past few years exposing financial institutions to a potential spike in credit costs in case of sudden economic or interest rate shocks. In the past two years, personal loans grew around 24 per cent and credit card loans grew 28 per cent on average compared with overall banking sector’s credit growth of around 15 per cent, Moody’s Investors Service said. According to the report, banks would be able to absorb higher risk weights on their capital because the overall banking sector’s exposure to unsecured retail credit is small at around 10 per cent of loans as of September 2023 and the sector’s overall capitalisation is at historically high levels with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.9 per cent as of March 2023. However, the impact of the new underwriting rules could vary among individual lenders depending on their exposure to unsecured loans, it said.',\n",
              "       'GDP growth may decline marginally to 6.3% in 2024: Goldman SachsIndia’s real GDP growth rate is likely to moderate marginally to 6.3 per cent in 2024 from estimated 6.4 per cent growth for 2023, according to a report from Goldman Sachs. However, it is likely to be a tale of two halves, the report said. “Subsidies and transfer payments as we head into the general elections in Q2 2024 will likely be the growth driver in the first half. Post-elections, we expect investment growth to re-accelerate, especially from the private side,” Goldman Sachs said. “While we expect the government to continue its focus on capital spending, given the medium-term fiscal consolidation path, the rate of growth in capex will likely decrease from next fiscal year,” the report said. Risks around the growth outlook are evenly balanced in our view with the main domestic risk emanating from political uncertainty with elections approaching in Q2 2024. Goldman Sachs said repeated supply shocks along with stable growth are likely to keepinflationabove the central point of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target of 4.0 per cent in 2024. “We forecast headline CPI inflation to decline to 5.1 per cent year-on-year (average) in 2024, above the RBI’s and consensus forecast of 4.7 per cent year-on-year, from an estimated 5.7 per cent in 2023,” it said. “We expect the government to intervene through subsidies or other measures to keep a lid on food prices in an election year. While core goods inflation declined in line with our expectation in 2023, the decline in core services inflation took us by surprise, especially given resilient growth,” it said. Going forward, core inflation is expected to decline to 4.5 per cent year-on-year (average) in 2024 from an estimated 5.1 per cent in 2023. Somewhat elevated inflation relative to target will limit the room for monetary easing. “We forecast the RBI to cut only 50 bps to 6.00 per cent by early 2025. Our US economics team forecast the easing cycle to start in Q4 2024, and forecast a higher neutral rate for theFedat 3.50 – 3.75 per cent, above the central bank’s current estimates of long-run sustainable levels,” it said. The “higher-for-longer” global scenario and elevated inflation domestically will mean continued hawkish guidance and tight banking system liquidity from the RBI until theMonetary Policy Committee(MPC) feels confident about inflation aligning with the 4.0 per cent target, Goldman Sachs said. Higher oil prices, slower growth in trading partners, and steady domestic growth is likely to increase thecurrent account deficitby 60 bps to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2024. “While services exports have peaked (as a share of GDP) in our view, they will continue to cushion a wide goods trade deficit in 2024. Foreign portfolio inflows from India’s inclusion in a global bond index should help fund the current account deficit,” Goldman Sachs said. “Over the last two years, Indian policymakers deftly managed a difficult combination of multiple commodity (food and oil) supply shocks and high Fed funds rate,” it said. They did so through a combination of monetary tightening, using fiscal policy to absorb some supply shocks, and judicious use of forex reserves to maintain a stable currency. Macro-economic resilience in recent years aided India’s inclusion in the JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index (beginning June 2024), and could prompt passive inflows of around USD 25-30 billion over the scale-in period. “With India benefiting from regional supply chain diversification, we expect continued direct investment inflows, although capital inflows will likely remain muted globally in a high interest-rate environment. Overall, we think the current account deficit should be comfortably funded next year,” Goldman Sachs said.',\n",

              "       'Scamming the scammers: How borrowers create fake IDs to deceive fake loan appsBasic media editing and computer skills, a ‘clean’ phone, some determination and Rs 300 — that is all it takes to turn the tables and scam predatory lending apps. Using fake documents and phone data, people who have been borrowing small sums from instant loan apps have found a way to dodge the usurious interest rates and continuous mental harassment that borrowers usually face at the hands of dubious digital lenders. Over the last four months,The Indian Expressspoke with a range of stakeholders including borrowers, fintech intermediaries, government functionaries, big tech companies and former RBI officials that pointed towards how, in the absence of any government and regulatory norms, online platforms such as Meta,Google,Apple’s App Store and WhatsApp carry out little due diligence and let fraudsters openly advertise predatory loan apps. In Part 2 of this series, The Indian Express details how an entire online ecosystem has mushroomed to take on loans issued by fraudulent apps. An investigation has revealed that for a mere Rs 300, unscrupulous borrowers use ‘information packs’ – forged government-issued ID cards, text message folder, contact list and a photo gallery full of images generated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) – that are sold on messaging app Telegram. All that the borrower needs then to pull off a successful con on the app is an empty phone to load the forged documents (Aadhaarand PAN cards) and information packs (fake text message folder, contact list and photo gallery) to create a fake digital trail. The fake digital history looks convincing enough for a loan app to then issue the money — typically between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000 for a week. The harassment to repay the loan usually starts around the fifth day. Speaking to The Indian Express, a person involved with a groups that sells fake information packs to create fraudulent digital trails said, “All that this job requires is minimal editing skills on platforms like Photoshop and entry-level computer knowledge to create a database of contacts on an Excel sheet and convert it into the vCard (a Virtual Contact File) format so thatAndroidphones can read them.” One such group on Telegram, named ‘Instant Loan Apps,’ has over 9,000 subscribers. “For those of you who did not know!! What is this channel for? Answer: You will get Bank SMS transaction data and call logs and contacts … with the help of this you will get approval in 7 days loan apps,” read a recent message on the group. In another Telegram group, named ‘Fake loan apps’, the directions were fairly simple: “do not use your primary phone… buy a clean phone… and install all the data we are sharing”. Fraudulent loan apps usually target borrowers by leveraging the personal data they collect from their phones. Besides loan apps requesting access to a borrower’s contact list, text messages, call logs and photo gallery, they also require a user to upload photos of their Aadhaar and PAN cards. Once a person gives necessary permissions and submits government-issued IDs, they are subjected to abuse and harassment during the recovery process. Fraudsters usually leverage two key details from theAadhaar card— father’s name and address — while harassing a borrower for loan repayment. A person involved with a Telegram group said, “Due to their very nature, most fraud loan apps don’t have a way to ping the Aadhaar registry to check whether the ID provided by a user is authentic.” The person added that recovery agents either extract the photo on the submitted Aadhaar Card or use the ID to shame the person publicly. The person said, “By submitting a fake Aadhaar Card that may have your name but an incorrect number and address, (you) can go a long way in ensuring that the fraudsters behind loan apps don’t harass you.” Explaining how the fake information packet helps fool a loan app, they said the fake text message data is compiled to mimic the texts a typical user’s phone would contain like bank transactions and promotional messages from various companies. “Loan apps look at such messages as a check to ensure that a person is constantly transacting or receiving money — a sign of an active bank account,” the person from the Telegram group said. While fake call logs ensure that a person’s phone number seems active, the fake contact list protects one’s real contacts who could be hounded by recovery agents later. The person from the Telegram group said that access to a borrower’s contact list serves a dual purpose for a fraud loan app. First, it allows recovery agents to reach out to a borrower’s contacts with abusive messages when the borrower defaults on the loan. Second, every contact in a borrower’s phone is a database of potential borrowers. Fraudsters send messages to a person’s contact, luring them with promotional offers that are too good to be true, in the hope that some of them will fall into their trap. There is collateral damage too. People who create fake call logs and contact lists usually purchase contact data in bulk. While several entries in such databases are non-working numbers, there are active numbers too. “Recovery agents may send harassing messages to people using active numbers, thinking they are related to the borrower,” the person from the Telegram group said. Since loan apps are aware of these steps being used to swindle them, they may reject a person’s loan application on the slightest suspicion of fake documents being used. And this is where “hunters” come in. These are people who “hunt” for apps that offer loans based on fake documents and data. The “hunters” then keep sharing information on such apps on their Telegram groups so that people can apply for loans using forged data. Talking about user safety while using an instant loan app, Sugandh Saxena, CEO, Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), said, “Be mindful of the privacy permissions you grant to a loan app. If a loan app seeks access to your photo gallery and contacts list, do not install it.”',\n",

The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years. “In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,” he is quoted as having said in the release. He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country. “The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts. “Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,” he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality. He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages. Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities. “Apart from improved infrastructure and the government’s pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,” he said. He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business. “…but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,” he said. He also noted Kerala’s startup journey has been an inspiring one. The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena. KSUM is the Kerala government’s nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state. Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world’s top business incubators. The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India’s biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here. Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.',\n",
              "       'Fraud loan apps have a free run on social media platforms. Here’s howBharat Singh, a resident of the eastern village of Ghosi in Uttar Pradesh, borrowed Rs 15,000 for his sister’s wedding through a loan app he came across on Instagram called UnicashX. There was little guidance if this was a genuine lender. Instagram didn’t raise a red flag and nor did the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Singh didn’t suspect much since the app claimed it was backed by a non-banking financial company (NBFC), and NBFCs are regulated by the RBI. But soon enough, he had to pay a heavy price — not just usurious interest rates but also continuous mental harassment. UnicashX demanded Rs 50,000 back, more than thrice the borrowed amount. When Singh did not pay back beyond the Rs 15,000 borrowed, he received a message on WhatsApp, which left him terrified: “I will hurl such abuses at you that you will consume poison.” Over the days that followed, he was incessantly harassed on WhatsApp by unknown people. Singh is not alone. Over the last 11 years, the digital lending market has soared, and by 2023, it is estimated to have touched $350 billion, having grown at a compounded annual growth rate of almost 40 per cent, according to Experian, a credit information company. Of course, much of this is powered by genuine fintech companies backed by NBFCs and banks. But under the radar, hundreds of scrupulous players emerged. While there are no official estimates, industry players said the illegal lending market could be at least $700-800 million. Over the last four months,The Indian Expressspoke with a range of stakeholders including borrowers, fintech intermediaries, government functionaries, big tech companies and former RBI officials. A number of victims caught in the crosshairs of these apps and their testimonies point towards a common narrative: In the absence of any government and regulatory norms, online platforms carry out little due diligence and let fraudsters openly advertise predatory loan apps. The RBI doesn’t have a white list of registered loan apps, or even a negative list which is updated. Over the years, fraudulent firms mushroomed on the back of rapid growth in digital lending given its convenience. The government has not been able to bring stakeholders to agree on a set of guidelines to counter the menace. In fact, The Indian Express has reported around a dozen cases since 2020 where some of those caught in the trap of such illegal loan apps have allegedly died by suicide. The latest meeting to discuss the menace was held on October 13, with the Ministry of Finance, the RBI and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) participating. During the meeting, MeitY suggested that the RBI can design detailed know-your-customer (KYC) norms for lending apps, similar to the process that users have to follow before opening a bank account. “We refer to the process of company KYC as Know Your Digital Finance App (KYDFA),” Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar told The Indian Express. In September 2022, the RBI did release a set of guidelines for digital lending, but these were only for regulated entities — banks and NBFCs. So, whatever wrongdoing by a lending app and service provider (those engaged in recovery of loans among other activities), RBI will knock on the doors of the bank or the NBFC. But this doesn’t address the issue of fraudulent apps, which do not have any bank or NBFC association and thrive on a large pool of unsuspecting mid- to low-income people — including students, small shop owners, salaried people working with small establishments in Tier III and Tier IV cities — who are turned down by banks. The RBI did initiate some steps, but withdrew. In fact, in a meeting on illegal loan apps chaired by Union Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamanin September 2022, it was decided that RBI would prepare a white list of legal lending apps and MeitY would ensure only these are hosted onGoogleandAppleapp stores. The RBI finds this “cumbersome” and hence has not moved on it so far, The Indian Express has learnt. Similarly, an RBI working group had in August 2022 proposed creating an independent multi-stakeholder body called the Digital India Trust Agency to verify digital lending apps. This agency, too, is yet to see the light of day. The RBI did not respond to a detailed questionnaire. With neither the government nor regulators looking over their shoulders, these fraudsters are abusing a confluence of the most popular online platforms — Meta, Google and Apple app stores, and WhatsApp — to advertise and distribute their dubious apps and eventually harass users for payments. Dubious loan apps advertise on Instagram andFacebook, and despite whatever filters they claim to use, many such apps including those clearly red-flagged by the government itself continue to offer their services. On October 11, this paper spotted an advertisement on both platforms for a loan app called Windmill. Just a month before, the app had been tagged as fake by the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Cyberdost initiative for having been hosted from “hostile foreign entities”. Google and Apple have blocked thousands of such apps from their app stores. But fraudsters find ingenious ways to find their way back online. For instance, when a user clicks on the ad by a dubious loan app called PaisaWorld on Instagram, she is redirected to a site asking her to download a program which looks deceptively similar to Google Play Store. Fake apps are good at deceiving Google and Apple about the nature of their services. They present themselves as mere loan calculators or loan aggregators, and, in one case, even a food recipe recorder, to fly under the radar of the companies’ review process. Apple took down an app called Cute Sweet Food Record and another called Kevin Basketball Train Plan which offered instant loans from a platform called Trust Loans after these were specifically flagged to it. These apps projected themselves as general health and fitness apps with no connection to loan services, Apple told The Indian Express. After a review, they maliciously changed their features and functionality. Responding to queries sent by The Indian Express, a Google spokesperson said the company “continuously updates policies across all our products to keep users safe from emerging threats and bad actors”. The company also said it does not allow apps attempting to deceive users or enable dishonest behaviour including but not limited to apps that misrepresent or do not accurately and clearly describe their functionality. But such apps continue to find a place on the Play Store. Meta did not respond to queries asking if the company reviews such advertisements before publishing them, and if it solely relies on automated means for the review or involves humans in the process. A government official said social media companies were not serious about monitoring advertisements of fake loan apps. “This is problematic; there is huge money to be made out of such advertisements. It is nothing else but corporate greed that they are not doing a better job at filtering out such ads,” said the official, requesting anonymity since the government is in continuous dialogue with Big Tech companies. A senior social media executive, however, said when the government cracks down on such activities, at times some legitimate apps, too, get affected. In February this year, when the Centre banned over 90 apps it believed to be fake, legitimate lending companies like KreditBee, LazyPay and Kissht, among others, faced the brunt. While the ban was revoked after the government went through their documentation, an executive whose app was banned at the time said such regulatory uncertainty will make it difficult for them to build credibility with customers. Bharat Singh, who continues to receive calls and harassment messages, said the loan app had taken him to UnicashX’s website. Here the app claimed it was backed by an NBFC called Kemex Engineering Ltd and also had a picture of its certificate from the RBI. “I believed the app and took out a loan for Rs 15,000. It was the biggest mistake of my life,” he said. Kemex is a RBI-registered NBFC. When The Indian Express contacted Vinay Shankar, the director of Kemex, he said: “We are not advancing any kind of loan via any digital lending applications.” He claimed to have no knowledge of UnicashX. Of course, legitimate NBFCs, too, are worried since it takes just a few rotten apples to spoil the basket. “Some of the RBI-registered and highly rated NBFCs have been misrepresented by illegal lending apps and there is real concern that the issue could snowball into a much bigger one for NBFCs, so there is a need to nip it in the bud,” said Raman Aggarwal, director of the NBFC industry body Finance Industry Development Council. Led by banks, NBFCs and fintech companies such asPaytm, Cred, Indifi and KreditBee, the total digital lending in 2023 is expected to be $80 billion, according to Experian. Ten years ago, this was $5 billion. Most digital lending apps are either owned by banks or NBFCs, or have a partnership with NBFCs. For instance, Paytm has partnered with NBFCs including Aditya Birla Capital, Hero Fincorp, Piramal Finance, Clix Capital and others. Cred has an in-house NBFC.',\n",
              "       'India a $4 trillion economy? Adani to Fadnavis hail, but no official wordBillionaire Gautam Adani to two Union Ministers and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis among others on Sunday hailed India crossing $4 trillion mark though there was no official confirmation if the country has achieved the landmark. The finance ministry and the National Statistical Office did not immediately comment on the viral social media post on India’s GDP crossing $4 trillion. Highly placed sources said that the viral news was incorrect and India was still shy of that landmark. An unverified screengrab from the live tracking GDP feed for all countries based on International Monetary Fund data has been widely shared on social media, including by many including seniorBJPleaders. It is very difficult to have live tracking of GDP numbers of all countries as numbers of various sectors of the economy are available with a lag. “Congratulations, India. Another two years to go before India becomes the 3rd largest nation in terms of Global GDP by overtaking Japan at $4.4 trillion and Germany at $4.3 trillion. The Tricolour surge continues! Jai Hind,” Adani said on social media platform X. Many political leaders, including Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis hailed the achievement. “India’s moment of global glory as our GDP crosses $4 Trillion.The rise of #NewIndia under PM @narendramodi ji’s leadership is truly unparalleled,” Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said in a post on X. Another Cabinet minister, G Kishan Reddy in a post said, “Congratulations As The GDP Touches $4 Trillion For The First Time and Marches Ahead. On the course towards $5 Trillion Economy – Modi Ki Guarantee,” Reddy is Union Minister for Culture, Tourism and Development of Northeast Region as well as Telangana BJP president. Fadnavis also posted, “This is what dynamic, visionary leadership looks like ! That’s what our #NewIndia progressing beautifully looks like ! Congratulations to my fellow Indians as our Nation crosses the $ 4 trillion GDP milestone! More power to you, more respect to you Hon PM @narendramodi ji!.” D Purandeswari, BJP’s Andhra Pradesh president said, “Congratulations BHARAT on becoming a 4 Trillion Dollar Economy ! This phenomenal achievement has been made possible by the path breaking reforms introduced and implemented by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi Ji Government in the last 9.5 years.” India recorded GDP growth of 7.8 per cent during the April-June period of 2023-24, the highest in the past four quarters, on the back of double-digit expansion in the services sector, retaining its position as the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The 7.8 per cent GDP growth in the June quarter is higher than the 6.3 per cent recorded by China during the same period. According to the National Statistical Office (NSO) data released in August, the agriculture sector gross value added (GVA) recorded a growth of 3.5 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent in April-June 2022-23.',\n",

The leading player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) segment is also in talks with a leading domestic carrier for a long-term contract. The government is looking to divest AIESL, which has raked in an average annual revenue of around Rs 2,000 crore in the last three years. AIESL CEO Sharad Agarwal told PTI that the company has started doing checks for the aircraft of Kuwait Airways from September. “At present, AIESL carries out the maintenance works for the aircraft of various airlines, including Air India and SpiceJet…we are in talks with a leading carrier for a long-term contract. “Besides, discussions are going on with three to four foreign airlines for MRO works,” he said. Currently, a few planes of IndiGo are also serviced by AIESL. AIESL has also received approval from the government for carrying out certain checks for Boeing 737 MAX planes.According to its annual report for 2021-22, the company is planning to improve revenue generation by providing MRO services pertaining to existing capabilities to third parties (through aggressive marketing) and acquiring new capabilities. Various checks, including detailed structural inspections, as well as corrosion prevention works and structural repairs of aircraft are done by the company. At present, AIESL has around 5,300 employees, and the strength is likely to touch 6,000 by the end of this financial year. India is one of the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and domestic carriers have nearly 1,000 planes on order that are to be delivered in the coming years, which will also provide significant opportunities for MRO works.',\n",
              "       'Former RBI Governor S Venkitaramanan passes awayFormer Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), S Venkitaramanan, who managed the affairs at the central bank when the country faced two major crisis – balance of payment crisis that led to the pledging of gold and the securities scam triggered by Harshad Mehta – in the 1990-92 period passed away on Saturday after a brief illness. Venkitaramanan, 92, is survived by his two daughters and their families. He served as Finance Secretary in the Ministry of Finance for a period of four years from 1985 to 1989 when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister of the country. Venkitaramanan, who had finished his civil service career by 1990, moved on to Karnataka as an adviser to the Governor during President’s rule there, before taking over as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in December 1990 — an appointment that came on the back of Rajiv Gandhi’s support whose backing was critical for the survival of the then Chandra Shekhar government. In the early part of 1991, up to April-May, when the balance of payment crisis deepened — marked by Indian banks even being denied overnight borrowings from abroad, NRIs withdrawing deposits and a downgrade by global credit rating agencies — at the RBI, Venkitaramanan began working on the phone with various central banks. When these banks wanted collateral or security in the form of physical gold, which had to be transported to the UK, Venkitaramanan managed all of it, including getting the Indian customs not to insist on import clearances or licences for some of the boxes to transport the gold. The rapid depletion of India’s foreign exchange reserves, which by that time, at a little over $1 billion, was enough perhaps to cover just three weeks of imports. There was the secrecy of operations: the first tranche of the pledged gold (20 tonnes) helped raise $200 million as India went to polls in May 1991 after the tragic assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Another 47 tonnes of gold raised $400 million and subsequent measures by a new government led by Narasimha Rao marked an end to crisis management and firefighting then. According to many officials who worked with him during that period, as a crisis manager, Venkitaramanan was brilliant. Some though do say that his pro-growth and pro- industry or corporate stance also could have contributed to the build-up of the economic crisis in the mid to late 80s which he himself had flagged. What they are referring to is the period from 1984 to 1988-89, when the government followed an expansionary policy, which boosted growth but led to the crisis. That was the period when Venkitaramanan was the finance secretary. The securities scam involving then high-flying broker Harshad Mehta triggered a crisis in the stock markets and the banking system in 1990-91. Investors lost heavily as the stock market plummeted and the badla system was banned. Where he lost his sheen was after the securities scam of 1992: there was much criticism and he had to go after a two-year term — one of the shortest in the last three decades. His term as the RBI Governor ended on December 21, 1992. Expressing condolences, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “very sad to hear about the demise of S Venkitaramanan. He was an outstanding personality and public servant. Made immense contribution during periods of crisis. May his soul rest in ternal peace.” Many of India’s top politicians, civil servants and economists of that era are unanimous in their opinion that he was perhaps one of the brightest civil servants that the country has seen. Back in Tamil Nadu, where he began his career, he promoted many of the corporations and institutions when he was just a deputy secretary — relatively low down in the pecking order. And that was innovative thinking to ensure that Central government funds were available for the state to spend! Venkitaramanan was born in Nagercoil, which is now part of Tamil Nadu. He completed his Master’s degree in physics from University College Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. and also earned a Master’s degree in Industrial Administration from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, the USA.',\n",
              "       'US court rejects appeal against Cristiano Ronaldo’s hush money settlement in Las Vegas rape caseA US appeals court has denied claims made against Cristiano Ronaldo by Kathryn Mayorga and her lawyers to pay more money than the $375,000 in hush money he had after she accused him of raping her in 2009. Mayorga’s lawyer had asked the9th Circuit Court of Appealsto overturn the dismissal of the case in June 2022 and reopen the civil lawsuit she first filed in Nevada in 2018. The appeal argued the federal court judge in Nevada erred in repeatedly rejecting the victim’s attempts to unseal and include as evidence the confidentiality agreement she signed in 2010 in accepting payments from Ronaldo. This was disagreed by the three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based appellate court in the latest development. “The district court clearly recognized the gravity of dismissing the case and accordingly provided a thorough analysis, amply supported by factual findings,” Judge Johnnie Rawlinson wrote in Tuesday’s 6-page opinion per The Associated Press (AP). The case dates back to 2009 when Mayorga, a former teacher and Las Vegas based model, accused Ronaldo of sexually assaulting her in her bedroom. The Portuguese footballer and his lawyers have maintained their stance that the act between the two parties was strictly consensual. Last year, Judge Jennifer Dorsey in Las Vegas had levied\\xa0a $335,000 fine against Mayorga’s lead lawyer, Leslie Mark Stovall, for acting in “bad faith” in filing the case on his client’s behalf. “I find that the procurement and continued use of these documents was bad faith, and simply disqualifying Stovall will not cure the prejudice to Ronaldo because the misappropriated documents and their confidential contents have been woven into the very fabric of [plaintiff Kathryn] Mayorga’s claims,” Dorsey’s ruling had read. “Harsh sanctions are merited.”',\n",

Vikram RathourBatting coachThe schedule-maker The only coaching staff to be associated with this team since Ravi Shastri & his men left the space. From the time he came on board after the previous World Cup, he has been harping about the need to be a lot more aggressive with the bat. And it is only at this World Cup that the world got to see the true potential and might of India’s line-up. Not the most gifted batsman during his playing days, after hanging up his boots, Rathour spent a few years in England before returning to coach Punjab and Himachal on the domestic circuit. He was also a national selector whenVirat Kohliwas captain. The 54-year-old is at the forefront of India’s training sessions, where he usually makes the schedule. A firm believer in giving batsmen freedom to go for shots irrespective of the format, Rathour has publicly backed the likes ofRohit Sharma,Rishabh PantandShreyas Iyerwhen they have been dismissed going for the big shots in Tests. Behind the scenes, he prefers to have one-on-one sessions with batsmen on almost a series-by-series basis. Not known to tinker much with their technique, but also the first to jump in and have a say at the nets if he sees something missing. To make it easier for the players, he instructs the team’s data analyst to video-record their net sessions and play it later on. He is known to seldom show his emotions and was even tipped to take a top role at the NCA. T DilipFielding coachFormer math teacher One who got extremely popular during the World Cup for introducing the ‘best fielder’s medal’ in the Indian dressing room, Dilip doesn’t have any cricketing background. With just tennis-ball cricket behind him, coaching became his calling from a young age. First up, he worked in age-group academies inHyderabadbefore he got a chance to work with Deccan Chargers in the IPL. At the now- defunct franchise, he would get a chance to be with renowned baseball coach Mike Young, who coached Australia in the past. And from there on, his graph kept moving upward. With no playing experience, Dilip would then enrol for a coaching programme at the NCA, where he would work with former India fielding coach R Sridhar. This was a period when he used to take maths tuitions to fund his coaching education and once he cleared the exams, became a regular face at the NCA. During the off-season, Dilip was a regular presence at the NCA zonal and annual camps, during which time he caught Dravid’s eye. Though Dravid had mostly worked with Abhay Sharma as the fielding coach during his stints with five Under-19 and A teams, the former India captain handpicked Dilip for the national team. With the Indian team, apart from maintaining the fielding standards set by Sridhar, his biggest contribution is how he has turnedKL Rahulinto a thorough wicketkeeper. With unique coaching gear, he has been spending hours together to get Rahul’s positioning right. Strength and conditioning Soham DesaiAn avid mountaineer  He started his foray in cricket with the Gujarat Ranji side between 2014-16. He spent a good part of 18 months working with a private fitness studio where he trained some popular personalities inChennaiunder the guidance of Shankar Basu, the former S&C coach, who was instrumental in improving fitness standards. From there, as the NCA revamped its S&C programme, Desai was at the forefront of it, spending four years at the academy before being promoted as assistant at the Indian team during the Covid years. Once Nick Webb vacated the seat, Desai, who’s an avid mountaineer, became the lead S&C coach after the 2021 T20 World Cup. S RajnikanthRehab master  A very popular figure, he is the one players turned to when they are undergoing rehab. Even when he was not associated with the NCA, injured players like Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer have sought him out to regain full fitness. Having been part ofDelhi CapitalsandGujarat Titansset- up in the past, Rajnikanth joined NCA recently, where he monitored the rehab programme of Bumrah, KL Rahul, Shreyas and Prasidh Krishna. Thanks to his relaxed training programme, he ensured everyone regained full fitness and with the World Cup in mind, the Indian team brought him on board to specially oversee these four players. Hari Prasad MohanVideo and data analystTeam’s eagle eye  A left-arm pacer, who gave up professional cricket to pursue a degree in engineering. Soon after completing bachelor’s degree in Information and technology, during which time he captained his college team, Hari joined Sportsmechanics which has been associated with the Indian team since 2000. Part of the backroom staff, he spent several hours studying footage before being part of the Tamil Nadu Ranji team. His biggest breakthrough came when CKM Dhananjay stepped aside as the Indian team analyst post the 2019 World Cup, and Hari stepped into his shoes. One can always spot him sitting with his laptop next to India’s coaching staff. He is the team’s eagle eye, who feeds the players the weakness and strengths of their opponents. Meticulous in detailing, he is a data man out and out. Rishikesh UpadhyayaLogistics ManagerDJ-in-chief  He has been Team India’s logistics manager for the past eight years.

This is Upadhyaya’s second stint with the team. He is also the go-to-man when players need some loud music to play in the dressing room, with his Punjabi collections being extremely popular among players. Masseurs Arun KanadeRelieving aches  Mumbai’s Arun Kanade has been part of the Indian cricket team for more than eight years now. He also had a stint with IPL sideRoyal Challengers Bangalore(RCB). Kanade shares a great rapport with Team India captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and other senior players. His main task is to ensure players’, especially bowlers’, muscles are relaxed before every game. Kanade had replaced the hugely popular Ramesh Mane, who was fondly addressed as ‘Mane Kaka’,and worked with the Indian team for close to a decade. Rajeev KumarMuscle Dr  Rajeev Kumar too is one of those support staff players contact immediately after the day’s play or during the innings break. Like Ranade, Kumar’s work starts after the match, when the players need to loosen up their muscles. Kumar shares a very good rapport with Team India’s pacers. Kumar, became popular on social media after Mohammed Shami shared a picture on Twitter celebrating his birthday alongsideIshant Sharmaand Kumar in 2019. Kumar celebrates his birthday on September 1, followed by Ishant’s on September 2, and Shami’s on September 3.

Throwdown specialists Raghavindraa DvgiKohli gives him credit  Aka Raghu, he is the senior-most among India’s three training assistants. Hailing from Kumta taluk in Uttara Kannada district, Raghu first became part of the Indian support staff back in 2011 during the tour of Australia. Endorsed by the likes ofSachin Tendulkarand Rahul Dravid, he had also attended the fabled Ramakant Achrekar summer camps for a couple of years. Such was his tenacity to play the sport that Raghu once even took shelter in a Hubli graveyard when he didn’t have a place to stay. His impact as a throwdown specialist can be gauged from what former skipper Virat Kohli once said, “I believe the improvement this team has shown while playing fast bowling since 2013 has been because of Raghu.” Nuwan SeneviratneEx-school bus driver  From Colombo, he is a former first-class cricketer who was part of the Sri Lankan set-up before he joined the Indian support staff in 2017. Unable to make more than two appearances on the domestic circuit back home, there was a time when Seneviratne earned his livelihood as a school bus driver. Cut to 2023, and he’s one of the key reasons behind India’s top order chiselling their skills against left-arm quicks.

              "       'Coach Igor Stimac’s moves backfire as 0-3 defeat in World Cup qualifier to Qatar ends India’s 15-game unbeaten run at homeIt was hard to decipher India’s strategy against defending Asian champions Qatar at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. It was understandable that they wanted to defend against a team ranked 61st in the world, 41 places higher than them. But in a vital FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier, India coach Igor Stimac decided to bench goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, undoubtedly the best player the last two times India faced the 2022 World Cup hosts. Not just that, the Croatian made four changes among the outfield players from the team that stunned Kuwait 1-0 in the opening game of the campaign. The result of those changes was that India lacked coordination, especially when defending. And they were made to pay the price by their much taller, stronger, and in-sync opponents. The final scoreline read 0-3 but Stimac would know that the score could’ve been much more humiliating had Qatar converted even half of the chances they created. This was more than just a World Cup qualifier for India. It was also their toughest preparatory game ahead of the AFC Asian Cup in January, where similar or tougher tests await them. It was a chance for Stimac to show that India has attacking flair and a solid defence. But with Amrinder Singh replacing Gurpreet, the defence led by Sandesh Jhingan looked shaky from the start. Amrinder looked overawed by the occasion and responsibility. He had a nightmarish game with the ball at his feet, giving it away three times in the first half itself. Qatar were coming from a 8-1 thrashing over Afghanistan. Coached by Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal and Real Madrid, they almost took the lead in the second minute when a misplaced pass from Amrinder allowed their star striker Almoez Ali to walk into the Indian box and square it to Akram Afif. Just about four yards in front of goal, Afif fluffed his chance to send it wide much to the relief of the packed Kalinga Stadium, which had former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in attendance. It didn’t take long for Qatar to redeem themselves, courtesy of some chaotic defending by India. Just two minutes later, India managed to head Afif’s corner out of the box, only for a Qatari player to send it back in. The ball pinballed in the Indian box and Udanta Singh’s failed clearance was met by the quick Mostafa Meshaal, who sent into the bottom corner. An early goal seemed to ease the pressure of the away match and Qatar kept displaying their attacking flair and prowess, launching attack after attack, with the Indian defence just about managing to hold out. Changes don’t work In the defensive set-up, Stimac brought in Anirudh Thapa for SahalAbdul Samad, and at left-back, he replaced Ashish Mishra with Subhasish Bose. Benching the in-form Mahesh Singh and starting with Udanta Singh was also a risk that didn’t pay off as India didn’t look threatening on counters. It was only after the half-hour mark that India started showing glimpses of what they are capable of. Probably their best move of the match came in the 35th minute when Thapa and Udanta played a series of one-twos to enter the Qatar box before Thapa pulled it back for Apuia Ralte waiting at the top of the area. TheMumbaiCity FC playmaker, who was easily India’s best player in the match, skied his shot into the stands. However, that attack gave India belief that they too could penetrate the Qatar defence, which leaked four goals against Iran in their last friendly. Thank you, Bhubaneswar for all your support tonight 💙 It means a lot. Always. 🇮🇳#INDQAT⚔️#FIFAWorldCup🏆#BlueTigers🐯#IndianFootball⚽pic.twitter.com/eKrEVX1kib — Indian Football Team (@IndianFootball)November 21, 2023 Thapa had India’s best opportunity of the match in the 42nd minute when Sunil Chhetri’s persistence helped him rob a Qatari defender and play the ball to Thapa. With just the goalkeeper to beat, Thapa tried to be cheeky and poke the ball from the edge of the box, but it was well wide of the target. Qatar doubled their lead in the first minute of the second half, as Almoez got on the scoresheet. Boualem Khouki sold Lallianzuala Chhangte a dummy and floated a lovely ball out to Afif waiting in the box. Afif smashed it at goal and Amrinder could only palm it under his body but Almoez, Qatar’s record goalscorer who scored four against Afghanistan, slid in to take his tally to 80 for his country. Stimac made two changes early in the second half, bringing in Mahesh in place of Udanta at the start and getting Sahal in place of Thapa a little later. It was then that India started combining well and looked threatening. Sahal had a good chance in the 65th minute, finding himself in acres of space inside the box after a brilliant through ball by Suresh Singh, but he dragged his left-footed shot wide, probably not realising how much time he actually had. Qatar put the game to bed in the 85th minute with substitute Yusuf Abdurisag scoring with the simplest of headers at the near post, and just like that, India’s15-game unbeaten run at home was broken. While they were certainly outplayed, they did show that it was possible to create chances against Asia’s best. They, however, need to find a striker capable of making a nuisance of himself against tough defences, for as it stands, Stimac’s men are yet to register a shot on target in more than 270 minutes (three matches) against Qatar.',\n",
              "       '‘He doesn’t have a brain, he’s lost it’: Hikaru Nakamura’s dig at Vladimir Kramnik over ‘garbage’ accusations of cheatingThe world of chess seemed to be heading towards another feud off the chess board after former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik presented new statistics on his Chess dot com profile that he purportedly believes reveals cheating by a player in blitz games. Kramnik, who has off late taken it upon himself to “expose cheating” in online chess games, frequently posts what he calls evidence for deceit in online games. While Kramnik didn’t name anyone in his allegations (which were then shared by GM Ian Nepomniachtchi on social media platform X), it led to American GM Hikaru Nakamura to hit back at the former world champion and Nepo in a lengthy Twitch stream on Tuesday where he took potshots at the former world champion Russian for “not having a brain.” The latest feud over alleged online cheating started off when Kramnik, in a post late on Monday, said: “Some small new piece of statistics, recently noticed, a player had scored 45.5 out of 46 CONSECUTIVE 3 minutes blitz games against approximately 2950 in average rating opposition (few different players) which is equivalent to 3600+ performance in those 46 Consecutive games. I believe everyone would find this interesting (SIC).” Hours after the tweet, Nakamura took to his Twitch account to live stream a rebuttal of sorts to the claims. He also said that Kramnik and Nepo had made disparaging comments about him away from the internet as well. “I don’t know what Kramnik’s thinking. At the end of the day, it’s very disappointing to see him doing this. I’m sure he’s going to go back and say he was just giving a stat and that it doesn’t mean anything. I know behind the scenes they (Kramnik and Nepomniachtchi) have said stuff about me. It’s hard to take this in good faith. I would hope he leaves it to the actual experts… the people who are mathematicians and statisticians, who do know what they’re doing,” Nakamura said in his stream. Vladimir appears to be referencing my record…is he really accusing me of cheating???@LevitovChess.@lachesisqare you jumping on this accusation as well by tweeting this garbage??https://t.co/NO17P0RH3H — Hikaru Nakamura (@GMHikaru)November 20, 2023 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Despite Kramnik not naming him, Nakamura explained how he figured out it was about him. “Kramnik was really stupid… If he wanted to do it in a way for it to be anonymous, he would have never put the average rating and the performance. Because there are about three players who can do it: Magnus Carlsen, Daniel Naroditsky (American GM) and me. Magnus hasn’t been playing that much online. If Kramnik actually had a brain, he would have found a way to do it without specifically listing it that way. But he doesn’t have a brain. He’s lost it,” said the American GM. Kramnik’s post was then shared on X by two-time world championship contender Ian Nepomniachtchi, who shared a screenshot of it, with the comment: “Because he’s the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.” Nakamura took offence to the claims and called the statistics “garbage”. Just last week, Nakamura broke the record for the highest blitz rating on Chess dot com with scores of 3336. Responding to Nepo’s tweet, Nakamura said: “Vladimir appears to be referencing my record…is he really accusing me of cheating??? … Are you jumping on this accusation as well by tweeting this garbage??” Responding to a comment from a fan on his livestream asking him to challenge Kramnik to a blitz game, Nakamura said: “What’s the point? Kramnik’s not doing anything in good faith anymore. I don’t think anybody should play Kramnik in blitz, cause all he’s doing is using those games to compile garbage stats and trying to claim that online chess is completely broken. I would never play Kramnik. Period!” While it remains to be seen how Nepo and Kramnik respond to the rebuttal video and the tweet, this will certainly spice up their upcoming battle at the FIDE Candidates tournament in April next year, where Nepo and Nakamura will be two of the top players vying for the chance to challenge World Champion Ding Liren for the crown next year. Besides the duo, the India pair of Vidit Gujrathi and Praggnanandhaa R are also in the fray. Just two months back, Kramnik had declared that he will not play games on Chess dot com anymore due to “too many obvious cheaters” on the platform. Even back then, he had refrained from naming any player. But it came on the back of controversy around American GM Hans Niemann, who had only recently agreed to a ceasefire with former world champion Magnus Carlsen. The World No 1 Carlsen had alleged that Niemann had been cheating in over-the-board games against him, which had led to a lawsuit, which also involved Nakamura as he had amplified Carlsen’s allegations against Niemann. Eventually, the suit was settled out of court. The Russian legend has said: “I promise I will continue trying my best to save chess from this disease.”',\n",

Having impressed with their takedown of former World Cup champions in England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Afghanistan will visit the country in January for a three-match T20I series. The first of the three games shall be played on January 11, 14 and 17. The series will be sandwiched between the India’s tour of South Africa – three T20Is, as many ODIs and two Tests – and the five-Test series against England at home starting early February. It’ll be a first-ever three-match T20I series between the two nations. The two teams have played five T20Is against each other so far, with India having won four of them while their last contest – a gold medal match at Asian Games in Hangzhou – ended with no result. India however, were deemed winners being the higher seeded team going into the final. At the 2023 ODI World Cup, theRohit Sharma-led side emerged victorious against Hashmatullah Shahidi and Co by eight wickets with the Indian skipper scoring a record-seventh ton in the competition.

              "       'Stop-clock to speed up play, banning transgenders from women’s cricket: Decisions at ICC board meetingThe International Cricket Council’s board met in Ahmedabad on Tuesday where it came up with a new gender eligibility regulation, pay parity for umpires, introduction of a stop clock on trial basis to speed up play and to move the ICC men’s U-19 World Cup from Sri Lanka to South Africa. Here are the key takeaways. Stop-clock trial Six years after the MCC’s cricket committee – that included the likes ofRicky Ponting,Kumar SangakkaraandSourav Ganguly– recommended a ‘shot clock’ to prevent teams from wasting time, the ICC board has introduced a stop-clock system. Under this regulation, which will come into effect from December 1 and continue till April 2024, a clock will be used to regulate the amount of time taken between overs. So how does it exactly work? Once an over is finished, the fielding team will have to be ready within 60 seconds to bowl the next over. The match officials will start the stop-clock once an over is called. “If the bowling team is not ready to bowl the next over within 60 seconds of the previous over being completed, a five-run penalty will be imposed the third time it happens in an innings,” the ICC said. What is the need for a stop-clock? Simply, to improve over rates. Last year, taking cue from T20 leagues, the ICC introduced an in-game penalty in ODIs and T20Is. As per the existing rule, if the fielding side is behind the clock by the time the innings is supposed to be finished, they have to bring in an additional fielder inside the 30-yard circle for those many overs. But despite this, there were numerous instances where teams still lagged behind. Now with the introduction of a stop-clock and five penalty runs, teams would be punished more heavily in the match itself, while the old monetary fines will continue to be applicable. No transgenders in cricket Similar to what other sports bodies have done, the ICC has revised its transgender policy. Under the new regulations, any player who has transitioned from male to female and has been through any form of male puberty will not be allowed to participate in women’s international cricket, regardless of any surgery or gender reassignment treatment they may have undertaken. What was ICC’s earlier criteria? Earlier, a transgender woman had to keep testosterone serum to 5 nanomoles or below for a period of 12 months. This was in line with the International Olympic Committee’s recommendations. But with the IOC recommending that each sport come up with its own policies, the ICC has revised its stand. The new rule means Canada’s Danielle McGahey, who became the first transgender player to feature in international cricket earlier this year, will no longer be eligible to play women’s cricket. McGahey, originally from Australia, had fulfilled ICC’s old criteria that made her eligible to play in the Women’s T20 Qualifiers for the 2024 T20 World Cup. How do other sports deal with the issue World Athletics says no transgender athlete who had gone through male puberty would be permitted to compete in female world ranking competitions. FINA – swimming’s world governing body – also stops transgender athletes from competing in women’s elite races if they had gone through any part of the process of male puberty. In 2020, World Rugby became the first international sports federation to say transgender women cannot compete at the elite and international level of the women’s game. Under-19 World Cup in South Africa With Sri Lanka Cricket placed under suspension because of government interference, the ICC has moved next year’s Men’s Under-19 World Cup to South Africa. Though it gave the nod for Sri Lanka to compete internationally in bilateral and ICC events, the country has been stripped of hosting rights of the age-group competition, which would be a definite blow to their economy that is dependent on tourism and hospitality. While UAE was also considered as a possible host, since the tournament clashes with ILT20 in the Emirates, the ICC picked South Africa as it has a range of venues. The Rainbow Nation had hosted the event in 2020, when India made it to the final and lost to Bangladesh. The 16-team tournament will commence in the second week of January and run till the first week of February at four venues. With SA20 also scheduled to run simultaneously, it is not clear yet which venues will stage the U-19 World Cup. Pay parity The Chief Executives’ Committee (CEC) of the ICC endorsed a plan to accelerate the development of female match officials. This includes, having equal match day pay for ICC umpires across men’s and women’s cricket. And from January 2024, in every ICC women’s championship series, there will be one neutral umpire.',\n",
              "       'After suspending Sri Lanka Cricket, ICC snatches away 2024 Men’s U19 World Cup from island nationThe International Cricket Council (ICC) have replaced Sri Lanka as hosts for the Men’s U19 World Cup scheduled to be played next year and appointed South Africa to stage the tournament. The decision comes as a result of cricket’s world governing body controlling the fundings made to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) after it had suspended the national board for breaching its obligations as a member, namely for failing to manage its affairs autonomously and without government interference. Cricket South Africa (CSA) had hosted the event in 2020 as well, with the games being hosted in Kimberley, Bloemfontein, Potchefstroom and Benoni. Earlier this year, the Women’s T20 World Cup was also hosted in the country, which is going to host the next ODI World Cup in 2027. The previous U19 World Cup had been staged in the Caribbean and won by India, who clinched the title for a fifth time. Why the ICC had suspended SLC? The development had come on the heels of a turbulent World Cup campaign by the islanders, where they failed to progress through to the knockouts and won just the two games from their nine league stage outings. Following the dismal performance from the Sri Lankan men’s team at the ODI World Cup in India, Sri Lankan Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe had sacked the SLC management and appointed former World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga as the head of a seven-member interim committee to govern the cricket board. However, that was overturned by the Court of Appeal. Later in the week, the Sri Lankan parliament had unanimously passed a resolution demanding the sacking of SLC. Parties from both sides of the aisle had supported it. That resolution, passed by Sri Lankan parliament, was what irked the ICC, who have it in their guidelines to oversee an autonomous running of its member boards.',\n",

Walking out to bat at a popping Narendra Modi Stadium with Australia three wickets down for 47 in the World Cup final is a feeling he won’t ever forget. In his latest newsletter titled ‘My World Cup Final Wrap’, the Aussie number four went on to share some snippets on the atmosphere inAhmedabadafter India nabbed early wickets and looked in the game on Sunday, and how he copped with the same. “It was so loud and the wave of momentum India had was immense. The Indian team were getting into me and all I could say back, and very truthfully at that, was ‘I actually can’t hear what you’re saying over the crowd’,” Labuschagne conceded. “On this bus ride to the ground, there was fans lining the streets from about 5km out. It was amazing to see the fans get behind the game like they did.” If anything, the loud atmosphere helped the five-time champions to add a sixth world title. “A sea of blue in the crowd. Chills as the anthem plays.. a real ‘us vs. the world’ feeling. The underdog spirit we love.” The 29-year-old went on to add 192 runs for the fourth wicket alongside Travis Head as Australia emerged victorious by six wickets – the foundation for which was laid by the bowlers restricting India for 240. A performance that had led to the Motera crowd going silent. “Standing in the middle of a giant stadium with 130,000 fans in it who all went silent at this moment. We all just stood in the team huddle and took it in for a moment,” Labuschagne said of the ambiance around the venue afterVirat Kohli’s dismissal. However, it’s the wicket of the Indian captainRohit Sharmathat Labuschagne puts as a pivotal moment in the game. Despite the loss of Shubman Gill in the powerplay, Rohit had delivered anotherone of his classic quickfire starts at this tournament – 47 off 31 before he miscued one over the infield on the off side only for Travis Head to nab him. “It was huge in the context of the game. For Maxi to throw it up like he did and tempt Rohit into the shot, and then Heady to take this grab. It was massive.”',\n",

For Haryana youngster Anmol Kharb, it was a day for double delight as the Faridabad native first paired up with Vennala K of Telangana to score a 17-21, 21-15, 21-11 win over the pair of Taarini Suri and Shravani Walekar of Maharashtra before winning the girls’ singles title with a close win over Punjab youngster Tanvi Sharma. The doubles win meant that the pair of Kharb/Vennala won their first U-19 doubles title together and claimed the Rachel Goenka Trophy. It was Kharb’s first doubles title, who normally plays on the singles’ circuit. “It was a tough day for me as I had to compete in two finals but I am glad that I won both the titles. It’s my first U-19 doubles title of my career and I hope to win more such titles,” said Kharb. Kharb’s doubles partner Vennala K hails fromGuntur, Andhra Pradesh, and started playing badminton at the insistence of her father Sriniwas Reddy, who works as a ticket checker in Indian Railways and is a former ball badminton national player. The Gopichand Academy trainee is also a fan of world number and Asian Games champion doubles pair of Satwik Sairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. “I started playing badminton at the insistence of my father, who is a ball badminton player and would see my elder brother Lokesh Reddy play badminton too. We were playing together for the first time and to win the title along with Anmol feels special for both of us,” said the youngster, who was cheered by her father on the courtside. For 17-year-olds Mayank Rana of Sonepat, Haryana, and Sanskar Saraswat of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, it was also the first time of playing together in the tournament. The doubles pair eked out a 21-15, 21-16 win over the pair of Rohan Anandas of Telangana andRahul DravidBatti of Andhra Pradesh to claim the boys’ doubles title and the Anant Goenka Trophy. Rana, whose father Vikas Kumar works as a teacher, started playing badminton for fitness. “I was fascinated by badminton and when I took up the sport seriously, my father would take me to the badminton academies in Sonepat. Later, he decided to send me to train at Gopichand Academy in 2020. I play singles as well as doubles and playing in both the categories helps me mentally as well physically too,” said Rana, who had earlier reached the final and semi-finals of a couple of All India Junior Ranking Tournaments with different partners. The pair won their maiden Junior Ranking U-19 title too with the win on Monday. After the win, Sanskar Saraswat was busy talking over the phone with his father Raj Saraswat, a former badminton player and now a coach. “While Mayank and I have been training at Gopichand Academy for the last three years, we had paired up for the first time for this tournament. After the win, we plan to continue the partnership for next year too and we expect to win more such titles. Like others, we too are big fans of the world number pair of Satwik Reddy and Chirag Shetty,” said Saraswat. For Kanchipuram native Pravandhika R, Monday brought her first mixed doubles title along with Bharath Sanjai of Tamil Nadu as the mixed doubles pair eked out a 21-12, 21-11 win over the top-seed pair of Bhavya Chhabra and Manya Ralhan ofDelhiand Punjab. The mixed doubles pair, who claimed the Sasha Goenka Trophy, sounded ecstatic after the title win. “My father E Raghavan is a coach in Kanchipuram and badminton was the only thing which I looked forward to playing in my childhood. I mostly play doubles and we both were pairing for the first time here. To win against the top seed for our maiden title feels special for both of us,” said 17-year-old Pravandhika. Her partner 18-year-old Sanjai of Coimbatore too ended a title drought after a few final finishes in the All India Junior Ranking Tournaments. “I guess this venue is lucky for me. I had partnered with different partners and we reached the finals including tournaments at Bahadurgarh andChandigarh. Playing at the national level also helps one’s confidence and I am glad that we won a title at the year-end,” said Sanjai, whose father too is a badminton coach. Chandigarh youngster Rijul Saini won the N Haridass Rolling Trophy for being adjudged as the tournament’s best player (girls) while Lalthazuala H of Mizoram was adjudged as the best player of the tournament (boys) and claimed the Aiyappa Trophy. Tenth-seed Saini had lost to eventual winner Anmol Kharb in the girls’ semi-final on Sunday while Lalthazuala lost against Pranauv Ram in the boys’ final. Ankit Malik of Haryana was adjudged as best boys’ player of Haryana winning the Aggarwal Trophy while Medhavi Nagar of Haryana was adjudged as the best girls’ player of the state and won the Neera Dutt Trophy. In the past, London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal had won the girls’ singles title in 2005 while double Olympics medallist P V Sindhu won the title in 2010. Last year, Bharat Raghav had won the boys’ singles title while Tara Shah had won the girls’ singles title in the tournament. National coach Pullela Gopichand’s wife P V V Laxmi had become the first girls’ singles winner in the tournament in 1991. “The tournament had seen more than 1,150 entries this year and like in the past, we are glad that we saw the emergence of some budding talents like Anmol Kharb, Tanvi Sharma and Pranauv Ram apart from others. We will also select players for the National Academy for Juniors atGuwahatifrom this tournament,” said Sanjiv Sachdeva, former Indian chief junior coach and member, selection committee, Badminton Association of India, and tournament director.',\n",
              "       'Cricket World Cup Final: Brett Lee says favourites India lost to Australia’s ‘never ever give up’ mentalityFormer Australia pacer Brett Lee believes that the old Aussie “mentality” overpowered the “favourites” India in theWorld Cup finalat the Narendra Modi Cricket Stadium in Ahmedabad. “If you look back on statistics and what has happened this campaign, India should have won,” Lee told foxsports.com.au. “India should have won the tournament with their men on paper, with their current form leading into the final. “India were definitely favourites, 100 per cent favourites, but it’s that old Aussie mentality to never ever give up and that goes a long way in big tournaments. “There was a lot of people that wrote the Aussies off saying they weren’t a chance, they did get off to a slow start. “But they proved once again last night that with that tenacity, dedication and self-belief amongst the team that you can actually pull anything off. “They actually dominated right from ball one.” Lee also said that India missed a track by preparing slow track in the final with the kind of fast bowlers they had in their ranks. “I was surprised, if you have a look at the Indian attack,Mohammed SirajandMohammed Shami, they’ve been on fire this World Cup. “It’s the quick bowlers who have been doing very well so I actually thought they’d try to knick off the Aussie top order. “If they could have made some serious inroads early, that would have been their best way to try and take out that 240 and dominate. “I was surprised they prepared a low and slow wicket which didn’t help them.”',\n",

              "       'Why the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup format we saw in 2023 is not good for the gameAt the end of 48 matches where Australia, perhaps inevitably, were crowned champions, there is a lingering question that the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup leaves us with. What is a “World Cup” supposed to be? This is not to be confused with the questions surrounding the 50-over format itself. That is for another day. This is also not supposed to be about India not being able to win the ICC title that has eluded them for more than a decade now, despite all the resources at their disposal. Trying to answer that will take a whole week. This is, at its heart, a question surrounding what a tournament of this magnitude is supposed to mean for the game. Because, as it stands, the last two editions of this tournament have been played in a format that is rigged to favour the best teams to rise to the top. It is not a format meant for fairytales. It is not one designed for shock and awe because the shocks are almost always temporary and the awe is fleeting. It is a tournament where teams fight it out for a league phase that seems to last forever followed by just three knockout matches. Sure, there can be a school of thought that goes: yes, the best teams will surely now play each other in the end. A World Cup is for the best teams, is it not? But cricket is already so restrictive in featuring just 10 teams (for the men, the women still only have 8 teams). The “World” barely exists in the World Cup as it is, and this format has almost nearly rendered the “Cup” meaningless. Essentially, it is a Champions League. That is why the Netherlands defeating South Africa – a result that had far-reaching consequences in the slightly more global T20 World Cup – barely caused a ripple at CWC23. That is why Afghanistan defeating Pakistan – a momentous, generation-defining result for a team on the rise – meant nothing in the larger scheme of things. Australia losing two matches, New Zealand losing four matches meant only the order of top four was ever in question – and that too, not for very long. This is no slight on Australia’s recovery or New Zealand’s ability to find an optimum level of operation to reach the business end. They did just what they had to do in a tournament that allowed them breathing space to recover from setbacks. But on the flip side, it is impossible to escape the fact that this is essentially a format that enables broadcasters and powers-that-be to bank on at least nine guaranteed matches for the likes of India, Australia, and England. The game itself is more global, so comparing cricket with football is perhaps too simplistic. And followers of football would tell you that the Fifa World Cup format will soon have its issues too. But, at the very least, it is a tournament that allows for miracle moments. It lets the mighty powerhouses in the world to feel the pressure of an early defeat. Some recover like Argentina did last year after losing to Saudi Arabia. Others can’t, as we have seen many times in the past but more recently with Morocco and Japan making the most of outperforming giants like  Belgium and Germany. Those huge wins for the lesser-favoured meant something immense. Even some of the most incredible Cricket World Cup matches from the past have been knockouts. The highs of the 1996 quarterfinal between India and Pakistan in Bengaluru followed by the shock of the semifinal inKolkata. South Africa’s many incredible semifinal (defeats). Australia – after having won in 1999, 2003, 2007 – finally letting the crown slip, at the hands ofYuvraj Singh-inspired India inAhmedabad. Even in the just concluded edition where Head broke hearts in the final, there is a strong case to be made for the two most exciting matches – the most tense, the ones with most at stake – to be the two semifinals. The 70-run margin wouldn’t fool any of us into thinking the India win against New Zealand came at a canter inMumbai. The South Africa-Australia clash in Kolkata would go into the annals of famous matches in the tournament’s history. Sure there were a few thrillers smattered here and there during the league stage, but as mentioned earlier, the result of most of the group matches just couldn’t have the same impact on a tournament. Simply, that sort of jeopardy simply isn’t possible when the focus of a Cricket World Cup is to dedicate the majority of the eyeballs for the big teams, with 3 knockout matches out of 48 in total. In 2027, there will be at least a minor course correction with the men’s ODI World Cup tournament going up to 14 teams. But as per ICC, the format is set to two groups of seven, with the top three in each group progressing to a Super Six stage: yet again minimising the possibility of a major team exiting early barring a disaster. Unless and until the focus shifts from maximising air time for the game’s behemoths to actually producing a tournament that has more knockouts, more possibilities for the underdog, and more thrill for a neutral, the Cricket World Cup will remain a misnomer.',\n",
              "       'Chennai scare against Australia saw Team India opt for sluggish track for World Cup finalThe scare that India got in their first World Cup game against Australia at Chennai prompted the Indian team management to opt for a sluggish pitch for the final in Ahmedabad. However, this would prove to be the home team’s folly as Australia was able to break India’s unbeaten 10-win streak. In India’s opening game of the World Cup, Aussie pacers Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc had reduced the hosts to 2/3. And hadMitchell MarshpouchedVirat Kohli’s skier off a Hazlewood ball soon afterwards, it would have been 20/4. The Australians were defending only 199 and the fielding lapse turned out to be terminal. India would go on to win the game easily but the scars of the trip toChennaistayed. The Indian Expresshad learnt that ahead of the final, the Indian think tank was worried that if the Aussie pacemen could give them a bloody nose on a spinner’s paradise at Chepauk, the consequences could be far worse if the conditions were even slightly in their favour in the final. That was the reason the Indian team management opted for the pitch that was used for the Pakistan game. That slow surface was as un-Australian as possible. Besides aiding their spinners, the pitch minus pace helped skipperRohit Sharmain taking the attack to the opposition during the first Powerplay. With the surfaces not yielding much pace or movement to the seamers, Rohit could afford to hit through the line, and even step down the track to disturb the bowlers’ length. The fast starts he provided allowed the later batsmen to settle in without worrying too much about the run rate. Even in the final, Rohit was the main reason India reached 80 after the first 10 overs, even though they lost three wickets in the process. But the tactic would backfire and India played right into the Aussie hands. The track became too sluggish for India’s liking, their batsmen struggling to find any sort of rhythm in the afternoon against the assortment of cutters, slower balls, off-pace bouncers and hard-length balls, while becoming much better to bat on under lights. Under the sun, the Virat Kohli-KL Rahulpartnership had far tougher conditions to face as compared to the time when Travis Head and Manus Labuschagne milked the Indian bowling in the evening. The Australians seemed to know what type of pitch would be on offer and were well prepared for the challenge. The home team, on the other hand, seemed surprised and out of sync with the kind of pitch on which they had been bred from an early age. India got pitches that suited their strength throughout the World Cup. It worked perfectly for a month and a half – all parts of the Indian cricketing ecosystem seemingly pulling inone direction– before backfiring spectacularly against the supremely-determined and prepared Australians in the biggest match of them all. It showed in India’s itinerary as well as the hosts played their league games against Australia, England, Pakistan and South Africa on the spin-friendly surfaces of Chennai,Lucknow,AhmedabadandKolkata, while the Sri Lankans, who didn’t have too strong a seam attack, were sent toMumbai, where the twilight hour made batting a hazardous exercise. It was a common sight at every venue to see head coachRahul Dravidexamining the pitch closely, with reports of the team management’s demands regarding every playing surface coming out in public domain. According toDaily Mail, the ICC’s chief pitch consultant Andy Atkinson was virtually sidelined from the process at venues where the hosts were to play and wrote to the world body wondering whether the pitch for the India-New Zealand semifinal at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium was the best choice after the track was switched just days before the game. After the Chennai game against Australia, the home team went from strength to strength, looking unbeatable and unstoppable, but when their opponents in the final were confirmed, their anxieties came to the fore. The Aussies were much smarter and more resourceful than the Indians imagined, morphing into whatever shape they needed to take as per requirement while exposing the weaknesses in the Indian runaway train that had been papered over during their unbeaten run – lack of batting depth, dependence on a few players to lead the way, and inability to adapt to changing conditions.',\n",

Of his 24 wickets in thisWorld Cup, only one came in the final against Australia. “The Prime Minister told us that since we all had given our 100 per cent, we shouldn’t be disappointed. He said win or loss wasn’t in one’s hand, what was important was we played well and tried hard,” said a team member on the condition of anonymity. Shami took to social media and said he was thankful for the support the team got during the World Cup.“Unfortunately yesterday was not our day. I would like to thank all Indians for supporting our team and me throughout the tournament. Thankful to PM @narendramodi for specially coming to the dressing room and raising our spirits. We will bounce back!” he posted on X. Jadeja also acknowledged how the nation stood by the team that lost in the final. “We had a great tournament but we ended up short yesterday. We are all heartbroken but the support of our people is keeping us going. PM @narendramodi’s visit to the dressing room yesterday was special and very motivating.” Modi watched the action from the ground during the second innings with Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. Also present was Home Minister Amit Shah. Before Modi’s arrival in the dressing room, coach Dravid had a chat with the team. He pointed to the positives and advised the players to move on. With his coaching contract ending with the World Cup, Dravid and the Indian board officials will be in talks in the coming days before a final decision on his assignment is taken. In his post-match press conference, the seemingly drained out Dravid said he was undecided about his future as India coach. “Honestly, I haven’t thought about it. I think all our campaign, all our energies were focused on this match, focused on this tournament, and focused till here. And I haven’t actually given it any thought. I have no plans of what’s going to happen in the future,” he stated. He also shared the mood of the dressing room. “He’s (Rohit) disappointed, as are many of the boys in the dressing room. There was a lot of emotion in that dressing room. It was tough to see as a coach, because I know how hard these guys have worked, what they’ve put in, the sacrifices they’ve made. So, it’s tough. It’s tough to see that as a coach, because you get to know these boys personally. You get to see the effort they put in, the hard work that we’ve put in over the last month.” After the game, Rohit was seen hiding his teary face under the cap. Mohammad Siraj, dragging his feet, also broke down.',\n",

Raman posted a carousel of photographs on her Instagram account after Australia defeated the Indian cricket team by six wickets in the Cricket World Cup final at theNarendra ModiStadium inAhmedabad. The photos also included a message for fans. “aaaaand cue all the hateful vile DMs. Stay classy… Can’t believe this needs to be said BUT you can be Indian and also support the country of your birth where you have been raised and more importantly the team your husband plus father of your child plays in #nobrainer. Take a chill pill and direct that outrage towards more important world issues (SIC),” the Indian-origin Raman wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. Raman, who is a pharmacist, married Maxwell last year and the couple have a young baby. Maxwell got Australia a crucial breakthrough in the final against India by getting the wicket of highflyingRohit Sharma, who was batting on 47. That wicket took the wind out of India’s sails. He wasn’t needed to do too much with the bat with Travis Head scoring 137 runs and more or less assuring a sixth World Cup trophy for Australia by the time Maxwell came in to bat.

              "       'Arsene Wenger on how to improve Indian football: Equip players from 5 to 15 with the best possible technical skillsFormer Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday that India must focus on equipping upcoming players with the best possible technical skills before they turn 15 as a possible means to find their place on the global football map. “What will football be like in 2030? How can we imagine what our needed quality is in 2030? But what is for sure, is where we start with technique,” Wenger said. “Football is a technical sport. We have to equip the players from five to 15 with the best possible capacity to be technically at the top. That means, basically, to make it simple, is to make the ball his friend. The rest can be developed later. And this is absolutely vital.” Wenger cited the example of Japan, where he had been a coach with Nagoya Grampus before his move to Arsenal. “I was in Japan at the start of their football in 1995. In 1998, they were at the World Cup. So that means it is possible. You have to start early,” he said. Wenger and his team from the FIFA Talent Development Scheme are currently on a three-day visit to India in connection with the AIFF-FIFA Academy to be inaugurated in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. The AIFF said  Wenger visited the Football House on Monday and had an interaction with the heads of a select group of football academies from across the country. Wenger said there is a “gold mine” of football talent in India that needs to be tapped so that the country can play a more significant role on the world stage. “My target is to improve football in the world. And it is impossible that a country like India, 1.4 billion, is not on the football world map,” the 74-year-old said. “My main target here is to convince people that there is a gold mine here, but at the moment it is not completely explored, exploited, and encouraged.” Wenger, who once oversaw an unbeaten Premier League season for Arsenal during a glittering coaching career, said that India has the resources to make it work. The Indian team have never participated in the history of the Fifa World Cup. “I believe you have huge assets, and fantastic qualities that make me very optimistic about what you can do here. It is absolutely fantastic to have that opportunity. And with my team, we are really highly motivated to help this country develop in the game. I’m convinced that it’s possible in the very short term.”',\n",
              "       'World Cup qualifiers: Sunil Chhetri-led Indian football team hopes to punch above its weight against Asian Champs QatarThe last time India grabbed a point from Qatar, the Gulf country created as many as 27 chances, the Indian defenders had to make 36 tackles and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a stunning 11 saves as India held the Asian champions to a goalless draw. It was four years ago, in the second round of World Cup and Asian Cup joint qualifiers. Much has happened since that game in Doha. A 10-man India lost their ‘home’ tie which had Doha as a centralised venue due to Covid restrictions, and the not-so-small matter of Qatar having hosted and played in a World Cup. As the two teams meet again at the same stage of the qualifiers, this time in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday, a lot has changed. India too have gone from strength to strength under coach Igor Stimac, with the 1-0 win away at Kuwait last week a testimony to it. But it’s nothing compared to the spur in growth Qatar have seen, especially since successfully hosting the World Cup. So when India host Qatar on Tuesday in their second match of the FIFA World Cup 2026 and AFC Asian Cup 2027 Preliminary Joint Qualification Round 2, it may seem like a battle of unequals but the hosts will go into the game with a belief that they can continue to punch above their weight. Before harbouring hopes of an upset victory though, India must figure out how to get a shot at the Qatar goal. In both their previous games, the Blue Tigers haven’t managed a single shot on target. Indeed, they defended resolutely and the stats speak for themselves, but the game on Tuesday is much more than a qualifier — it’s more about how India stand against Asian heavyweights, keeping in mind the all-important AFC Asian Cup in January next year. India have already shown a glimpse that they can go toe-to-toe against the better Asian sides, and their 2-2 draw against Iraq in September is a testament to that. The fact they won three trophies in 2023 – the Tri-Nations Series, Intercontinental Cup and the SAFF Championship – simply shows the steady improvement India have made. The youngsters especially. The under-23 men’s side reaching the round of 16 at the Asian Games after 13 years in arduous circumstances wasn’t seen as a one-off. They will also take courage from the fact that they haven’t lost a single game at home this year. “When you play high-level games consecutively without losing, facing Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait three times, Lebanon twice, Iraq and you don’t lose matches and keep clean sheets, it’s quite evident that you are consistent,” Stimac said ahead of the Qatar match. Nothing however would give them more confidence than their 1-0 victory over Kuwait in the first match of these qualifiers last week, courtesy of a brilliant goal by striker Manvir Singh. While India did beat Kuwait at home, beating them on their own turf would’ve been unthinkable even five years ago. It may have been their first World Cup qualifying win on foreign soil for the first time in 22 years but Stimac wants them to forget that victory. The Croatian believes, and one would tend to agree with him, that a positive result against Qatar is the only way forward. “I said to our players immediately after the Kuwait game in the dressing room that the best thing is to forget this game immediately. Save your energy from celebrating, being overconfident, and getting into euphoria. No, forget it. Let’s get preparing for the Qatar game. That’s the only way forward,” said Stimac. Qatar flexed their muscles in the 8-1 drubbing of Afghanistan to start the Asian Qualifiers in some style. Four of those goals came from the boots of their record top-scorer Almoez Ali, who was the MVP at the 2019 Asian Cup, and the Indian defence marshalled by Sandesh Jhingan is bound to have a busy time in keeping him silent. India would want to look at the games before the Afghanistan match though. Qatar were drubbed 4-0 by Iran and held 1-1 by Russia in their two friendlies since September. But coached by the experienced Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal, and a club like Real Madrid, they will want to continue their momentum from the Afghanistan match. They, too, would be looking at these matches as a preparation for their home Asian Cup and given how poor their World Cup campaign went (they couldn’t get a point), they would look at the January tournament as some sort of redemption. Stimac made a brave call in the Kuwait game, benching the pacy Lallianzuala Chhangte, who ironically came in and set up the goal for Manvir, the player who started in his place. With Manvir scoring, it’ll be difficult for Stimac to bench him against Qatar. While he went for an attacking lineup against Kuwait, he could go for a more defensive approach on Tuesday which could mean the talismanic playmaker SahalAbdul Samadmight have to make way for Anirudh Thapa. That would be unfortunate since Sahal has been electrifying in the Indian jersey and the majority of their attacks have come through him. Stimac however said on the eve of the match that he’s going to go all out. “It’s a game, where there is nothing to lose for us but a lot to win for. So let’s go for it all out,” he said. “We cannot control the external factors. We can only control our performances at the individual level and as a team. The only thing for us to do is to give our best for 90 minutes when the first whistle sounds.”',\n",

              "       'Haryana’s Anmol Kharb looking to walk in Saina Nehwal’s footstepsIt was moments after her fighting 21-13, 21-23, 21-16 win over Tanvi Sharma of Punjab in the girls’ U19 singles final of the Yonex Sunrise 30th Smt Krishna Khaitan Memorial All India Junior Ranking Prize Money tournament being organised by Express Shuttle Club Trust at the Tau Devi Lal Sports Complex. But the Haryana youngster 16-year-old Anmol Kharb remembered to take a picture alongside a poster of London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal outside the venue. Nehwal had won the U-17 and U-19 title in the year 2003 and 2006 respectively before her breaking onto the international scene and that’s what the Faridabad youngster, who won the Naidu Hall Trophy for winning the title, wants to emulate in her career. “Saina didi remains one of the pioneers of Indian badminton at the world level and I am glad that I could win one of the tournaments, which she won as a junior player. I was not born in 2006 but seeing her picture of winning the trophy in 2006 during the whole week inspired me a lot. Hopefully, I get to play international circuit soon in my career and make a smooth transition just like she did,” says Kharb while speaking withThe Indian Express. The Haryana youngster, whose father Devender Singh works as an advocate in Faridabad, had started playing badminton on seeing her elder brother Hardik play the sport. But her brother’s decision to concentrate more on his studies meant that the youngster had to go it alone after taking up the sport seriously. Initially, the Haryana youngster would play at the Dayanand Public School in Faridabad before she started training at the Sunrise Shuttlers Academy in Noida. “My elder brother would often take me to the badminton court and I took up the game as fun. Only when he told my parents that he wants to pursue engineering, I started taking interest in badminton. When I shifted my training base to Noida, it also meant my mother Rajbala Kharb would accompany me the whole day and wait at the academy for hours while I trained. This still remains the case and when I won the title today, she was cheering for me along with my father courtside,” says Kharb. In 2019, the youngster reached the U-13 quarters in the Sub-Junior Nationals atBhagalpurwhere she lost to Unnati Hooda. Last year, Kharb reached the final of the U-17 Sub-junior Nationals at Bhubaneswar apart from a semi-final finish in the U-19 Junior Nationals at the same venue. The year also saw her winning her maiden U-17 All India Ranking title atHyderabadand a semi-final finish in the Senior All India Ranking tourney atVisakhapatnam. This year, the youngster reached the pre-quarters in the Asian Junior Championships in Indonesia apart from claiming the U-17 crown at the Sub-Junior Nationals at Hyderabad. “At the Sunrise Shuttlers Academy, I train under coach Kusam along with Indonesian coaches and the foreign coaches have put the focus on getting my racquet face fully open apart from increasing the pace on  the shuttle. It has helped me at the U-17 level. The semi-final finish in the Senior Ranking tournament made me believe that I can compete at the senior level too when I get the chance. My focus is now on the U-19 as well as the senior level in the coming years,” says the youngster. Kharb also paired up with Vennala K of Telangana to win the girls’ doubles title and the Rachel Goenka Trophy with a 17-21, 21-15, 21-11 win. “I watch videos of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty bhaiya often and it helps to create the doubles placements in my mind. I am also a fan of Tokyo Olympics champion Chen Yufei and the way she manages the court and dictates terms is my favourite,” says Kharb.',\n",
              "       'After an unprecedented Cricket World Cup, India’s Virat Kohli ends up as tragic-heroIn the midst of the silence that engulfed the arena stood Virat Kohli, his vacant stare wandering into the skies, with the forlorn look of someone betrayed. He puffed his cheeks out in anguish and ruffled his hair, in unusual disorder, with long cold fingers, as he waited impatiently for the torture of collecting the player of the tournament plank, a souvenir of pain, on the most heartbreaking of all nights. Even in the most harrowing hour, he was the centre of the crowd’s attraction. A section of teary-eyed fans chanted his name, as glances of sympathy peered from every corner of the stadium. Those would have made his pain even more intense. Hastily, coldly, he picked the piece of meaningless trophy, its value no more than that of a stone, and hurried up the long stairway to the dressing room, the trophy dangling limply at his side. There, in the anonymity of a dark corner, he could finally weep, break down and wallow in the night that was and the night that never was. The day, and the night, had the promise of a perfect ending for a near-perfect batsman in an almost-perfect World Cup. It didn’t end that way. It’s a pain only sportspersons could fully comprehend; years and months of physical labour and mental preparation blown away in one aberration of a night. All the success of past crumbling in one night. The sun indeed would rise the next day, asRahul Dravidsaid in the press conference, gleaning from his own vast experience of heartbreaks, but the darkness will linger, the bitterness would cling on, the scar shall remain unhealed. The athlete in them would move on; perhaps not the human inside them. The defeat would haunt the 14 colleagues of his, the support staff and a one billion-plus population, but it would torment Kohli even more. For he was his country’s driving force, hope and dream. There were others around him too, but he was the central piece, the golden boy, on whom everything converged, the assurance behindRohit Sharma’s aggression, the stability behindShreyas Iyer’s enterprise, the groundswell of the crowd’s optimism. En route the final, Kohli scored three hundreds, each revealing a distinct quality of his, he equalled and went pastSachin Tendulkar’s record of most hundreds in the format, becoming the greatest ODI batsman ever. He collected 765 runs at 95, no batsman has ever scored as many in this tournament. Every knock of his was an expression of joy, an attestation of his frictionless greatness. But one bad night rendered it imperfect, turning the most memorable tournament into the most disappointing one. The disbelief when Kohli edged an innocuous Pat Cummins to the stumps conveyed his frustration. It was the day he badly wanted to make his own, yet it was not his. He batted perfectly for his 54, until that moment of indiscretion. If he were selfish, he would bask in the afterglow of his personal success. But he is not. Kohli is driven not by numbers or personal glory — these are just incidental achievements to the larger cause of winning accolades for his country. Kohli knows the taste of winning a World Cup. He was only 23, and just three years into international cricket, when he carried Sachin Tendulkar on his shoulders on a victory lap at the Wankhede after winning the 2011 World Cup. He was just a chubby-faced batting tyro, yet to shed his love of chhole bhature and butter chicken, yet to embark on his rigorous physique-chiselling regimen, yet to be among the Fab Four of the world, yet to be King Kohli. Between then and now, Kohli has swished past several milestones, conquered every country he has toured, subdued the demons that had besotted him from time to tine, led his country to historic series wins, became India’s most successful captain in the longest format, developed different layers to his game, added and subtracted shots from his repertoire. Yet, he would feel lost and abandoned after theAhmedabadnight of pain. The wait for ICC silverware after the 2013 Champions Trophy would tease and torment like an impish demon. In each of the white-ball tournaments since, Kohli weaved personal success. Twice they lost the semifinals of the 50-over World Cup, once each in the final of that tournament and the Champions Trophy. Twice in three T20 World Cups were India among the semifinalists after losing the 2014 final. The pangs of knockouts just keep piling on. Even if Kohli had collected winners’ medals in all these tournaments, the latest misery would have still crushed him. A supremely-driven and proud athlete that he is, every tournament that he had not won would remain a fresh scar. In the end, the missing blanks in the ICC tournament column would not diminish the batsman he is and the leader he was. He would not be consigned to one hundred years of solitude for this. Nonetheless, he himself would feel a sense of imperfection. Like it was for Sachin Tendulkar until he finally laid his hands on a World Cup three weeks before he turned 37. Kohli is two years younger now. But he would be 39 when the next World Cup winks in. His moment might have passed, or not passed. But it is hard to think that he would fizzle out into the twilight of his career. Rather, he would burn brightly for the redemption that could furnish his career with a perfect ending. His fitness and motivation would not be a concern, perhaps his reflexes would. Kohli would, if asked, dwell on taking it year by year, series by series, producing cliches like ‘four years is too far away.’ Whatever be the narrative that is yet to unfold, 2023 was Kohli’s World Cup, one wherein he was both the hero and the tragic-hero.',\n",
              "       'Ricky Ponting lauds Pat Cummins’ faultless captaincy, pinpoints ‘gutsy move’ that swayed World Cup final vs IndiaAfter Australia defeated overwhelming favourites India by six wickets in the Cricket World Cup final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting heaped praise on Pat Cummins for his “faultless captaincy” and picked out a “gutsy move” that influenced the final. Cummins won the toss atAhmedabad, and to everyone surprise, asked Indian to bat first. Even Indian skipperRohit Sharmaadmitted that he would have batted first had he won the toss. That moment proved pivotal, as the Indian team faced a rare batting slump and could only post a total of 240 runs. The five-time champions chased down the total with six wickets in hand, thanks to Travis Head scoring 137. When Ponting was asked about Cummins’ captaincy after the finale, he first dismissed the questions that have persisted over Cummins’ leadership. “I don’t know where the negativity’s come from because there’s been no real basis for it. You look at their overall Test record since he’s been captain, it is outstanding. And now he’s a World Cup-winning captain, a World Test Championship-winning captain and a captain who retained the Ashes, so that negativity needs to be put aside now. “I think that’s (his captaincy) been almost faultless, to be honest. “I thought his leadership actually has got better and better right through the tournament,” he said onSky Sportson Sunday Then he pinpointed a gutsy call Cummins had made. “Any captain deciding to bowl first at the toss, that’s a gutsy, courageous move. Australia felt that if they could bowl well on that dry wicket early on and restrict India, batting was gonna get easier in the second innings – but we all know if you get that call wrong and you lose the game, that’s a huge decision to make for a relatively young captain,” said Ponting who led Australia to World Cup triumphs in 2003 and 2007.',\n",
              "       'As Cong Dalit ministers demand SC internal quotas, Karnataka wants Centre to take the callThe Karnataka Congress government appears to have decided to put the ball in the Centre’s court over the implementation of the 2012 report of the Justice A J Sadashiva Commission. Dalit leaders in the state Congress have been demanding that the government accept the report and provide “internal quotas” to Dalits. The Commission had been set up by a Congress-Janata Dal(Secular) government in 2005, to look into the need for classifying Karnataka’s Scheduled Castes into sub categories for the purposes of reservations, and to find ways of doing it. According to sources, the government has taken this position because the report had already been “partially accepted” by the previousBJPgovernment. “The Justice Sadashiva Commission report is not up for consideration. The previous government had accepted parts of it and had already written to the Centre to clear a path for the implementation of internal quotas. The issue is now before the Centre,” said officials in the state Law Ministry. There is fresh urgency after November 11, when Prime MinisterNarendra Moditold a poll rally in neighbouring Telangana that he would constitute a committee to look into the demand for internal reservations for Dalits, made by the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS) in that state. Soon after, three Dalit Karnataka ministers — Home Minister G Parameshwara, Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa and Food and Civil Supplies Minister K H Muniyappa — along with seven-time CongressLok SabhaMP K H Muniyappa, requested Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to accept the report. In fact, Muniyappa, who belongs to the Madiga community — considered the most deprived among Dalits — has given a call to all Madigas to stage statewide protests demanding the implementation of the report. Two weeks ago, he had asked the community to stick to their demand for the implementation of the report in the state. The Madigas are the largest block of Dalits. They feel aggrieved by better-off sub-groups hogging most of the Dalit quotas, and consider the Sadashiva report to be key to the delivery of social justice, because it studied the socio-economic conditions of Dalits as sub groups. “In our SC/ST convention before the state polls, we adopted a declaration, one of whose points was the promise to table the Sadashiva Commission report in the first Assembly session itself,” said Home Minister G Parameshwara, who belongs to a smaller but better-off sub-group of Dalits called Holeyas. Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa, who is also a Holeya, however, believes the Sadashiva report needs to be considered, but only within the framework of the Constitution, and through consultations with the Law Department. Law department officials, however, are of the view that the implementation of the report is now the prerogative of the Centre, since the previous outgoing BJP government had partially accepted it and recommended internal quotas through a Cabinet sub-committee that studied the report. “The Justice Sadashiva Commission report was accepted by the previous BJP government and placed before a Cabinet sub-committee headed by the then law minister. After the sub-committee modified the recommendations, they were accepted by the government,” said sources in the state law department. The Sadashiva Commission findings Among the essential findings of the Sadashiva Commission, which were publicised through a press release in 2012, is that Madigas (SC Left), who are considered untouchable in the caste hierarchy, are more socially backward than the ‘SC Right’ groups like Holeyas, who are considered more acceptable in society. The commission also found that most of the existing 15% quota for 101 Dalit sub-groups was being cornered by the SC Right groups like Holeyas and new SC groups like the Bhovis and the Lambanis, while the most backward Madigas continued to be deprived. The report also indicated that while Holeyas and Madigas made up nearly a third each of the SC population in Karnataka, the Madiga numbers were about 2% higher than that of the Holeyas. The BJP had promised to implement internal reservations before the 2018 Assembly polls. In power, however, the BJP government then led by CM Basavaraj Bommai rejected the Justice Sadashiva Commission report, but said it could implement some recommendations made by the Cabinet sub-committee set up to study the report. The government ended up allotting 6% quotas to the SC Left (including Madigas, as suggested by the report), 5.5% to the SC Right (Holeyas), 4.5% to the touchables (Bhovis and Lambanis), and 1% to other Dalits. Before accepting the recommendations of the sub-committee, the Bommai government increased the overall quota for SCs in the state from 15% to 17%. Since this raised the combined SC-ST quota by 6% — taking total reservations in the state to 56% (OBCs 32%, SCs 17%, STs 7%), ie., above the 50% ceiling fixed by the SC in the 1992 Indira Sawhney judgment — the Bommai government asked the Centre to incorporate the changes into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, to prevent these from being overturned by courts. The poll boomerang Eventually, the Karnataka BJP’s move to hike the reservation quota of SCs and STs before the Assembly elections in May had not paid off. While the party failed to secure a single ST-reserved seat — it had won seven last time — its tally of SC-reserved seats dropped from 16 in 2018 to 12. In contrast, the Congress won 21 of the 36 SC-reserved seats (up from 12 in 2018) and swept the ST seats by winning 14 out of 15 (up from 7 in 2018), with one going to the JD(S).',\n",
              "       'Decoding Politics: Why is BJP raising two ‘comments’, one by Gehlot loyalist, another by his son?Poll-bound Rajasthan’s political discourse seems to be revolving around two key issues. Firstly, a comment by state Cabinet minister and Ashok Gehlot loyalist Shanti Dhariwal, which allegedly insulted the women of the state. Another issue that has grabbed the limelight is an alleged remark by Chief Minister Gehlot’s son Vaibhav, that the Congress government led by his father will not come back to power. So, how have the two issues become a frequent feature of the political discourse in Rajasthan? Dhariwal’s statement and the subsequent row On March 9 last year, a day after International Women’s Day, Dhariwal during an address in the Assembly said the high number of rapes in Rajasthan were due to it ‘‘being a men’s state’’. Replying during a debate on grants to the police and jails of the state, Dhariwal, who is also the Minister for Law and Legal Affairs, said, “We are number one in rape. Isme koi do raai nahi. Ab ye rape ke mamle mein kyu hai, kahin na kahin galti hai ye toh s**** (Why we are number one in rapes, there is a fault somewhere).” As a few MLAs behind him began speaking, Dhariwal turned around and said, “Rajasthan toh mardon ka pradesh raha hai. Ab uska kya kare? (Rajasthan has been a state of men. What can be done?)” The MLAs then burst into laughter. However, no protests were held in the Assembly over the remarks as the OppositionBJPhad staged a walkout before the minister’s address. However, later in the day, BJP state president Satish Poonia slammed Dhariwal’s comments and termed his “shameless confession of the state being number one in rapes” an insult to the women. “The remarks have also lowered the dignity of men. If the Congress has any morality left, such a minister should be sacked,” he had said. The National Commission for Women (NCW) had also taken suo moto cognizance of Dhariwal’s comments while the BJP created an uproar over them in the Assembly the following day. Dhariwal subsequently apologised and said his remarks were the result of a “slip of tongue”. The minister’s candidature for the polls hung in the balance with the Congress high command reportedly against it for his role in organising a separate meeting of MLAs loyal to Gehlot while skipping an official Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting last year. Eventually, he was fielded by the party from Kota North, which he represents in the current Assembly. The BJP has now dug up the year-old issue to slam the Congress. At a rally in Bharatpur last week, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiattacked Dhariwal without naming him. “The Congress has rewarded this minister with a ticket instead of punishing him. Even people inDelhi(Congress high command) agreed to give him a ticket. This raises a question of what “second red diary” is in the possession of jaadugar’s (Gehlot) favourite minister that even Delhi had to bow down to him. Every Congress leader knows the minister’s truth, yet they gave him a ticket as he has information about people in Delhi. After the BJP forms the government here, I promise to unravel that secret too,” Modi had said. This brings us to the question of what the “first red diary” is. The first red diary and Vaibhav’s statement The “red diary” first hogged the limelight in July after former minister of state Rajendra Singh Gudha claimed he was sent by the CM to retrieve the diary from the house of Gehlot’s close aideDharmendraRathore, whose house was being raided by central agencies amid a political crisis in 2020. Gudha’s claims came after he was sacked as minister by Gehlot, hours after he had slammed the state government in the House over the rise in crimes against women. The former MoS had urged his government to introspect on this, rather than speak on the violence in Manipur. Since his unceremonious exit, Gudha has been raking up the red diary while claiming that the CM has been regularly asking him whether he had burnt it. The former minister also claimed that Gehlot would be behind bars had he not retrieved the diary. Gudha has now joined theShiv Sena(Eknath Shinde) and will be in the fray from Udaipurwati constituency, which he won in 2018 as a BSP candidate. Last week too, the Udaipurwati MLA raked up the issue when he showed some pages of the purported diary to the media. “Vaibhav Gehlot says this government will not come back to power. I can give it in writing that my father cannot come back to power. Rajendra Gudha is not saying this. This is being said by Vaibhav Gehlot, the chief minister’s son,” the Udaipurwati MLA said while flaunting pages of the “red diary”, though there is no confirmation of Vaibhav having said this. The BJP and Modi have targeted Gehlot over the diary. “Some people say that there is a quboolnama (confession) of a son in the red diary, where he says his papa’s government will not come back to power,” Modi said at a recent rally. Modi raked up the issue again at a public meeting in Nagaur. “Gehlot ji, kya ho gaya? Aapka jaadu aapke bete par bhi nahi chal raha hai kya (What happened Gehlotji? Is your magic not working on your own son)?” he had said.',\n",
              "       'Rajasthan polls | ‘Will teach Congress a lesson’: The Sachin Pilot impasse may cost party in Gujjar beltTHE CONGRESS has survived a narrow win, one mutiny and one quieter rebellion in the last five years to stay in power in Rajasthan – all the while dogged by the Sachin Pilot question. Now, the BJP is cashing in. In 2018, the Gujjar community had rallied behind Pilot, electing 8 Gujjar MLAs from the Congress and none from theBJP. The BJP and Congress are matched in tickets to Gujjar candidates this time – 10 and 11, respectively – and the BJP is banking on the community favouring it, especially in eastern Rajasthan, where Pilot’s influence goes well beyond the Gujjar community. The BJP has been working on the plan for long. This January, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiaddressed a programme to commemorate the 1,111th ‘Avataran Mahotsav’ of Gujjar deity Devnarayan in Bhilwara. Former BJP chief ministerVasundhara Rajewas not present. It was under her term that over 70 Gujjars were killed during a violent reservation agitation. “The party has been trying to approach the community with a clean slate, and it will show in the results,” a BJP leader says. The ‘betrayal’ The BJP’s confidence is reflected on the ground. In Mitrpura in Dausa district – Pilot used to be an MP from this Gujjar-dominated seat, as were his parents Rajesh and Rama – three men of a Gujjar family slam the Congress’s “beizzati (insult)” of Pilot, after the 2018 party win was attributed to a large extent to his efforts as party president. Sumer Singh Gurjar, 52, says: “We voted for the Congress withtann, mann, dhan(wholeheartedly).Par daga kar diya Pilot ke saath(But they cheated Pilot).” The support for Pilot had also carried several Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste candidates of the Congress past the winning mark in 2018, despite the Meenas (who are STs) and Gujjars being considered traditional caste rivals. Sumer says the community continues to back Gajraj Khatana and Murari Lal Meena, but there are doubts over Gujjar support for Congress sitting ministers Parsadi Lal Meena, Mamta Bhupesh (SC) and MLA O P Hudla (ST), among others. The Gujjar-Meena bonhomie, or what’s left of it, was further strained by Parsadi Lal’s remark recently, saying: “Sachin Pilot, Rajesh Pilotko humne he panpaya hai(have thrived due to us). No one knew them before 1984. I was the lone Meena leader who was with them and supported whoever the party asked us to – be it Sachin, Rajesh or Rama Pilot.” In September, Congress MLA from Sawai Madhopur and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s adviser Danish Abrar faced the brunt of the anger over the Pilot issue in his own constituency. Considered a Pilot loyalist, he had sided with Gehlot during Pilot’s 2020 rebellion, when the then deputy CM and 18 other MLAs had parked themselves in hotels in BJP-ruled Haryana, ultimately failing to get enough numbers to break away. Visiting Sawai Madhopur for a programme to honour Gujjar deity Devnarayan, Abrar had been met with slogans of “Pilot ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro s*****n ko(Shoot those who betrayed Pilot).” The same month, a vehicle in which Niwai MLA Prashant Bairwa was travelling came under attack. Like Abrar, Bairwa too was considered close to Pilot but did not join him in the rebellion. In Dausa’s Kherli village, father-son duo Nihal Singh Gurjar and Ajay Singh, 26, say the Congress would have benefited had it implemented a formula of 2.5-years each for Gehlot and Pilot as CM. The high command’s efforts in this regard were constantly thwarted by Gehlot. Last year, Gehlot loyalists even stayed out of a CLP meeting which was understood to have been called byDelhito pick Pilot as CM. Nihal says they won’t vote for Bhupesh this time even if Pilot himself canvasses for the minister. The unhappiness with Minister Bhupesh, the MLA from Sikrai, is only partly it; Nihal wants to teach the Congress a “lesson” for Pilot being openly called “naakara nikamma”, as Gehlot has done more than once. There is another factor behind the winds of change in the Gujjar belt. The son of Gujjar reservation agitation architect Kirori Singh Bainsla, Vijay Bainsla, is a BJP candidate from Deoli Uniara Assembly seat, part of Tonk district adjoining Dausa. Tonk’s Muslim ‘anger’ In Tonk, Pilot’s own Assembly constituency – where they are the largest group among 2.5 lakh voters – the Muslims are also angry with the Congress government, their despair arising from its “silence” on issues affecting the community. However, they are largely forgiving of Pilot. This August, during a visit to Tonk, Pilot was accosted by Mohsin Rasheed, the Rajasthan coordinator of the Congress minority cell, who asked why he hadn’t spoken up on the Nasir-Junaid case, referring to the killing of two Muslim youths by “cow vigilantes”. He also questioned Pilot over the Congress favouring approaching the Supreme Court against the High Court’s acquittal of the Jaipur bomb blast accused, the suggestion being that they were not innocent. Pilot admonished him for “spreadinggalatfehmi(falsehoods)”. When the elections came around, Rasheed, 42, who has a significant following on social media, threw his hat into the ring. He later withdrew, on the counsel of “the community’s elders” and after assurances by the Pilot camp, he says. Rasheed still talks about Pilot’s muted response on issues affecting the community, including a recent statement by BJP Tonk district in-charge and controversial leader Ramesh Bidhuri that “Lahore is watching the Tonk polls”. However, out in the streets of Tonk, the general – and generous – view is that Pilot can’t afford to take a pro-Muslim stand and turn Hindus away. “Bidhuri has been sent to provoke tensions and if Pilot speaks, he might lose their (Hindu) votes,” says Anwar, 32, who runs a recycling shop in Tonk’s Kafila market, while adding that vote for Pilot is their “majboori (helplessness)”. Among a group at a tea-stall nearby, Arif, 45, says Muslims have no option other than the Congress. “Where else will we go?” After Muslims, the biggest chunk of voters in Tonk are SCs, followed by Gujjars, and then Jats, STs and upper castes. While Pilot’s candidature makes it a safe seat for the Congress now, it has voted almost equally for the party and BJP since the BJP was formed in 1980 – with the BJP winning in 1980, 1990, 1993, 2003 and 2013; and the Congress in 1985, 1998, 2008 and 2018. Last time, Pilot won by over 54,000 votes against the BJP’s Yunus Khan, an influential leader displaced from his traditional bastion. While Pilot is expected to win again, if not as comfortably, even staunch Gujjar supporters believe the government may be changing in Jaipur. One of them, Ram Gurjar, says the Congress should make amends and name Pilot as at least the Leader of the Opposition or the party state president, if the BJP wins. BJP candidate Ajit Singh Mehta, who won from Tonk in 2013, calls Pilot “an outsider”, who has “undone all the work done during my tenure”. “Pilot doesn’t know which village has water or electricity issues, or about the missing compounders and doctors at PHCs and CHCs.” He talks of pulling off an upset like senior BJP leader Smriti Irani did in Amethi, defeatingRahul Gandhifrom the family bastion in 2019. “Today, kings are not born in wombs… it is the people who decide,” Mehta says. “Pilot was the CM face in 2018, but this time the CM (Gehlot) has said the chair won’t leave him. So Pilot is contesting an MLA election, and so am I.” And then he brings up that ‘R’ word, saying people remember that Pilot is a leader who rebelled against his party. Back in Kafila, at another tea-stall, Abdul Raees, 63, says: “No party really helps us, but we want the Congress to come to power… We just want to live peacefully, that’s the only issue for us in Tonk.”',\n",
              "       'Today in Politics: PM Modi to chair virtual G20  summit; Amit Shah steps up Rajasthan campaignPrime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a virtual summit of G20 leaders on Wednesday evening, to discuss the implementation of the Delhi Declaration adopted in September and several new challenges that have emerged since then. Addressing a press conference inDelhion the eve of the summit, India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant said the deliberations will witness “excellent participation” from leaders of the grouping. China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin had skipped the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10. However, the Russian Tass news agency, quoting a Kremlin statement, has confirmed that Putin will take part in the extraordinary virtual G20 summit on Wednesday, adding that the Russian President had to miss the Delhi summit in September and the Bali summit in November, 2022, as he had to focus on the “special military operation” inUkraine. Kant described the virtual summit as “rare and exceptional” which would give Modi an opportunity to interact with the world leaders for a second time during India’s G20 Presidency before it passes on to Brazil in December. The virtual meeting of G20 leaders is taking place a day after leaders of the BRICS grouping held an extraordinary meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. On the domestic politics front, with just two days left for campaigning for the November 25 Rajasthan Assembly elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah will continue his campaigning in the state on Wednesday, addressing rallies in Pali, Jalore and Sanchore districts. The Rajasthan poll campaigning turned more bitter after Congress leaderRahul GandhiTuesday referred to PM Modi as a “panauti (harbinger of bad luck)”, linking his presence in the stadium to India’s loss against Australia at the ICC World Cup finals inAhmedabadon Sunday. This came a week after Modi had called Rahul “moorkhon ka sardaar” (leader of fools), responding to the latter’s statement that everybody in India has only Chinese mobile handsets.

Announcing theSamajwadi Party(SP)’s programme to pay tributes to the party’s founder, lateMulayam SinghYadav, on his birth anniversary Wednesday, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said that after the 2024Lok Sabhapolls, there will be a “big change” in the country and samajwadis will play an important role in it. “After 2024, there will be a different kind of a change in the country, and samajwadis will play an important role in it. The SP’s PDAYatrahas sent a strong message. The PDA will compete with the BJP and the NDA,” Akhilesh said, during his Picchde, Dalit, Alpsankhyak (Backward, Dalit and Minority) rally inLucknow. “Seeing the strength of the PDA, many parties are now supporting caste census. Even parties which had earlier stopped this, have now come in favour of caste census,” he said. The SP president said the caste census has been a longstanding demand for his party because it is crucial for social justice. “The first thing SP will do after coming to power is to conduct a caste census,” he added. InMumbai,Shiv Sena(UBT) MLC Anil Parab said the cross-examination of Shiv Sena (UBT) chief whip Sunil Prabhu, which began on Tuesday, will continue on Wednesday. Prabhu is being cross-examined by lawyers of the Shiv Sena (Shinde) in the case related to the disqualification of MLAs of the undivided Shiv Sena. “Cross examination of Sunil Prabhu took place today. He gave appropriate answers to all the questions,” Parab said, adding that Prabhu had demanded that his statement be recorded in Marathi, and sought an official translator who could record it, after alleging that it was not being done correctly. “We felt that many questions were not needed and there was a delaying tactic. They have to give judgment by December 31. There is a possibility that they could seek further time and we don’t want to give that,” Parab added. On September 18, the Supreme Court had directed Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to give the judgment on disqualification of rebel Sena MLAs by December 31, coming down hard on him over the delay in deciding the disqualification pleas filed by both Sena factions against each other. In Kerala, the LDF government’s outreach programme, “Nava Kerala Sadas”, will continue through Kannur district on Wednesday, when CM Pinarayi Vijayan will chair a Cabinet meeting at Thalassery. On Tuesday, Vijayan claimed the workers of the CPI(M) youth wing DYFI had saved the lives of some Youth Congress (YC) activists who had allegedly tried to jump in front of the CM’s cavalcade, waving black flags. He added that they had not been assaulted, as reported. The Congress contested the CM’s statement, claiming that the CPI(M) and DYFI workers had carried out brutal violence against Congress student wing Kerala Students Union (KSU) and YC activists. Earlier in the day, Vijayan, at a press briefing in Kannur, had said he was sitting in the front seat of the bus on which he and his Cabinet colleagues were travelling as part of the sadas, and saw the YC activists trying to jump in front of the vehicle. “It happened right in front of my eyes. The DYFI workers were trying to prevent them from jumping in front of the oncoming vehicle. They were saving the lives of the YC activists, for which some force had to be used. It was not an assault,” the CM said. – With PTI inputs',\n",
              "       'Ex-CJ defends rap on EC: if it’s seen tilting, it matters in a democracyAcknowledging the need for judicial restraint, Justice Sanjib Banerjee underlined that the Election Commission’s conduct can have “great consequences” for democracy as he defended his 2021 observations, as former Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, that “murder charges” should be imposed on the poll panel for violating Covid protocols during Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. “A judge should certainly be restrained. However, the Election Commission is an institution which has a great responsibility. So, if it is seen tilting, one way or the other, by even a very small degree, it can have great consequences for democracy,” he toldThe Indian Expressdays after he retired as Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court. After an 11-month stint as Chief Justice of Madras High Court, Justice Banerjee was transferred as Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court. He retired on November 1. “The case was being heard (in Madras HC) for a while and I felt there were some aberrations which is why those observations were made. Crowding in rallies and not following Covid protocol was certainly a concern and when the elections in West Bengal was held an eight phases, why was it held in a single phase in Tamil Nadu? You have to look\\xa0 at it in that context and not pick just two sentences,” Justice Banerjee said. “Also, one cannot say that the court can’t make any observations. Lawyers cannot be expected to argue with a wall. They have to get indications from the bench so they can tailor their case accordingly,” he said. The EC had moved the Supreme Court against these observations, terming them “uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory.” While the SC refused to expunge the observation or bar the media from reporting it, Justice Banerjee‘s observations were widely discussed in legal circles when he was suddenly transferred to Meghalaya, one of the smallest High Courts. When asked if he knew the reasons behind his unusual transfer, Justice Banerjee said that he is not concerned with the reason. “I am sure there were cogent reasons for my transfer but I am not aware of it. I received an email (from then CJI NV Ramana’s office) and I said yes. Once you become a judge, you cannot have any ambitions of holding a particular office. So there was no question of me not consenting to the transfer,” he said. A statement published by the Collegium on November 9, 2021 said that “the Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on 16th September, 2021, has recommended the transfer of Mr Justice, Sanjiv, Banerji, Chief Justice, Madras High Court to Meghalaya High Court.” While the statement cited no reason, Justice Banerjee said that the email only indicated that the transfer would be in the “interest of better administration of justice.” Justice Banerjee added: “But I would not have had it any other way. The work that happened in Meghalaya during my stint was very important. In my 11 months in Madras, I had very rewarding judicial work. But in Meghalaya, there wasn’t a lot of judicial work but we focused on infrastructure building.” On his stint in Madras, Justice Banerjee said that he was far from wanting to maintain the status quo and actively handled things in Madras High Court. “While the idea is that a Chief Justice who comes from outside takes a dispassionate view when it comes to appointments or other aspects, there is a flip side that they could end up being status quo-ists without wanting to ruffle too many feathers. By and large, the office of Chief Justice is considered a stepping stone for Supreme Court judgeship. It is to be somewhere but look elsewhere and not take steps to actively address the uncle judge syndrome when it comes to appointments,” he said. As a High Court judge for nearly two decades, he said, corruption in the higher judiciary worries him. “Punitive transfers are not enough. Corruption is an unimpeachable offence but it is difficult to gather evidence. These activities are not done in broad daylight but it is possible to collect some evidence of corruption. However, impeachment is a political solution. A compromised judge is convenient for all political parties. This is an aspect which erodes faith in the system and needs to be tackled,” he said.',\n",

TheBJPreacted sharply, accusing Gandhi of using abusive language against the Prime Minister because of the frustration of electoral losses. “Panauti… panauti… Achha bhalaa hamare ladke wahaan World Cup jeetne waale the, par panauti harwaa diya. TV waale ye nahin kahenge magar janta jaanti hai(Our boys were going to win the World Cup, but panauti got them defeated. TV channels will not say this but the public knows),” Gandhi said at a public rally in Balotra, Rajasthan. Rajasthan goes to polls on November 25. Just a week ago, Modi had called Rahulmoorkhon ka sardaar(leader of fools) after Rahul said everybody in India has only Chinese mobile handsets. “Congress leaders suffer a mental disease of not acknowledging India’s achievements,” Modi had said in Madhya Pradesh, and said India had taken rapid strides in mobile manufacturing. Earlier this year,Rahul Gandhiwas briefly disqualified as a Member of Parliament after aSuratcourt handed him a two-year sentence for his remark on the surname Modi. He was reinstated only after the Supreme Court stayed the sentence. Demanding an apology from Gandhi for his latest remark, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “What has happened to you, Rahul Gandhi? You are so troubled because of the frustration of losses that you are using abusive language against the Prime Minister of the country. Our Prime Minister loves our players and goes to boost their morale and to help them. The Bharatiya team is doing well in Asiads, Olympics and paralympics. Our players played very well. It’s all right – defeat and victory happen. Rahul Gandhi must apologise.” KC Venugopal of the Congress, however, defended Gandhi’s jibe. “Rahul ji has said what many have been thinking since 2 days! The World Cup finals was a moment of pride for 140 crore Indians and we were all looking forward to this historic occasion, but they were desperate to hijack it for their political mileage. The BJP should be the last ones to talk about political correctness. These Godse bhakts, including PM Modi, who have regularly insulted Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi ji, Sonia ji and Rahul ji with the most vile abuses are finding it difficult to digest the hard truth,” Venugopal wrote on social media platform X.

He had found himself at the centre of a similar controversy last year during the Gujarat Assembly elections. “We see your (Modi’s) face in corporation elections, MLA elections or MP elections, everywhere… Do you have 100 heads like Ravan,” he said at a public meeting inAhmedabad. The BJP had then accused Kharge of likening the PM to Ravan.

              "       'From the Urdu Press: ‘Cricket World Cup sets stage for India as sports host’, ‘BJP negative politics show no plans for Telangana’Cricket and politics defined the coverage of the Urdu Press over the week as a blink of theIndian cricket team in the world cup final,following a long dream run, broke a billion hearts. The Urdu dailies vied with each other to capture all the sights and sounds of the cricketing fiesta. The dailies have kept their gaze on the game of politics too, focusing now on the campaigning of the leading players in Rajasthan and Telangana, which are up for polls in the coming few days. Roznama Rashtriya Sahara Commenting on Australia’s win over India in the final of the ICC men’s cricket world cup, the multi-edition Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, in its leader titled, “Team India: match hara, dil jeeta (Team India: match lost, hearts won)”, writes that victory and loss are part of any game, which cannot be reduced to just the bare bones of results. It would not be fair to look at the performance of any sportsperson or team through the narrow prism of the outcome, because while taking to the field no one wants to put in less than their best efforts, the editorial says. “And this is also not necessary that the team which has been performing well consistently and appears invincible will never face a setback. In the cricket World Cup, for instance, the Indian team displayed excellent performance throughout the tournament, proving itself to be the world’s best team (before it was felled by the Aussies).” The daily highlights the accomplishments ofVirat Kohli, who notched up maximum runs while also breakingSachin Tendulkar’s iconic record by scoring his 50th century, andMohammed Shami, who emerged as the highest wicket-taker. “When Australia lost three wickets for 47 runs while chasing India’s modest total of 240, it seemed the latter had an edge, but Travis Head’s stellar knock of 137 backed by Marnus Labuschagne deprived India of its third World Cup title and gave Australia its sixth World Cup trophy,” it notes. The editorial points out that this was the first time that India hosted the entire World Cup event. “This edition of the biggest cricketing tournament was a grand success. This sets the stage for India to host other major global sporting events in future, which will entail the development of new cities and promote various sports among their denizens,” it states. This would also break entrenched social stereotypes that still remain heavily tilted in favour of academic studies, the edit says. “But social trends are changing now and so are people’s priorities. Efforts are being made to popularise various sports. Indian players are earning laurels in several new sports, thereby signalling that the future is also bright for the country’s other sportspersons besides cricketers.” Urdu Times Referring to Prime MinisterNarendra Modi’s address to media persons at theBJP’s “Diwali Milan” event at the party’s headquarters inDelhi, theMumbai-based Urdu Times, in its editorial on November 18, writes that the PM expressed concern over the dangers of the deepfakes produced through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the crises they can pose. The PM cited his own example to say that he recently saw a video of him performing garba even though he has not done so since his school days, the edit states. “The PM’s statement has reignited a debate on the issue on social media.” The daily says fake news is a huge problem in a country like India, which has set off several incidents of violence and even riots in which lives have been lost. “One of the common methodologies for spreading fake news on social media is the use of a wrong video for making a false claim. Deepfake is more dangerous since it is done through AI with such skill and precision that it can barely be recognised as morphed,” it says, adding that through such a hazardous technology any picture can be superimposed on any video to hit your target. The daily notes that actress Rashmika Mandanna recently became one of its victims. The AI will make the task of distinguishing truth from falsehood more challenging, with even genuine content running the risk of being dismissed as fake now, it notes. The editorial points out that the Israel-Hamas war has spawned many videos which have polarised the world. It says many people do not have the fact-checking capabilities. In an oblique swipe at the BJP, the edit charges that its IT cell has been indulging in misinformation and that PM Modi should ask its head to curb it. “The concern flagged by PM Modi over AI-generated fake content is valid, which must be endorsed by proponents of social media.” Siasat Referring to the upcoming voting in the remaining two poll-bound states, Telangana and Rajasthan, theHyderabad-based Siasat, in its editorial on November 20, notes that the campaigning by the leading contenders has reached a crescendo there. In Telangana, besides the top brass of the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) — including Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR, his son and minister K T Rama Rao, and minister T Harish Rao — senior leaders of the Congress and the BJP have been engaged in making their final push, it says. “The Congress has promised several guarantees and welfare schemes for people and has also issued a manifesto. The BRS has also made pledges on similar lines. However, it seems the BJP has set aside its development agenda, looking to garner poll dividends only through polarisation.” The daily notes that PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have led the BJP’s campaign in Telangana. “Shah also released the BJP’s manifesto, but did not announce any development scheme or programme, raking up emotive issues instead. He promised that the party will arrange for free darshan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya if the BJP is voted to power,” it says, adding that followers of other religions are also residents of Telangana. “Besides, the BJP’s manifesto promises implementation of the Uniform Civil Code.” The editorial points out that Telangana BJP chief G Kishan Reddy has been announcing that the BJP will form a “bulldozer government” if elected. “This is unfortunate that a party like the BJP which is ruling the country is resorting to the politics of fear and polarisation, instead of projecting its achievements, to garner votes in Telangana. The BJP does not seem to have any plan or programme to offer for the development of India’s newest state,” it says, calling the party’s Telangana strategy “negative politics”. “Is Telangana not facing various problems including price rise, unemployment and lack of basic amenities?” the edit asks, adding that using a divisive plank while steering clear of such basic public issues betrays a “cynical mindset”.',\n",
              "       'Alliance talks on backburner, BJP banks on Central schemes as Akalis aim for youth in PunjabSEASONED politicians from the BJP and Akali Dal want the two long-time friends to come together again. But, for now, this seems in suspended animation. Ahead of theLok Sabhaelections, while the SAD is trying to bank on youth to revive its political fortunes, theBJPis counting on Central schemes to strike a chord in the rural belt, a segment the saffron party had once left for its former ally to take care of. On November 14, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal launched a ‘Global Youth Membership Drive’ under the aegis of the “Punjab di shaan, saade naujawan (Our youth the pride of Punjab)”. As part of the drive, the SAD aims to give 50% party posts to youth aged 35 or below at the district level, and 40 years or below at the state level, apart from giving them “appropriate” electoral representation. Youth Akali Dal president Sarabjeet Singh Jhinjer toldThe Indian Express, “Within 24 hours of the launch of our drive, as many as 12,433 people enrolled as members.” He added that by November 20, around 32,000 people had enrolled for the drive, where anyone joining the organisation needs to give details like the constituency they live in, their phone numbers and a declaration that they aren’t facing any criminal cases. Senior SAD leader and former Nakodar MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala said, “The party’s focus is now on the next generation. They exercise a huge voice in the decision-making within their respective families at the time of voting. The political spectrum is moved by the youth. So, for any party to remain relevant, focus on the youth is of utmost importance. Hence, the Akali move.” Jhinjer said the youth who are enrolling would go on to be “future MPs, MLAs and members of the SGPC and zila parishads. At least 60% of the electors are youth, and they are the future leaders”. The SAD has announced activists who enrol the highest numbers of youth will be chosen as district presidents, with 2,000 being the minimum qualifying number in a district. The BJP, on the other hand, is focusing on beneficiaries of schemes sponsored by the Centre. Confined mostly to urban areas when it was an ally of the SAD, the Punjab BJP is now focusing heavily on rural areas, including via Shakti Kendras, to create a grassroots party cadre. To begin with, the party plans to appoint an activist each to head booths, and create a team of 15-20 volunteers at the village level. The ‘Viksit Bharat SankalpYatra’, the party’s flagship initiative to highlight centrally sponsored schemes, was kicked off on Wednesday from Ropar and Mohali districts, to be followed by Amritsar on Thursday and culminating in Tarn Taran on December 4. At a press conference on Monday, Union Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce Som Prakash and Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar alleged that the ruling AAP “specialises in taking credit for Central schemes and projects, where it has no singular contribution”. Som Prakash said that Rs 1,563 crore for four-laning of the Phagwara-Mukerian road and Rs 411 crore for the rail link between Talwara and Mukerian, were both sanctioned by the Centre. He added, “The AAP even tried to take credit for the Guru Ravidass Auditorium, which was built during the previous SAD and Congress governments.” At a meeting chaired by state BJP organisational secretary Manthri Srinivasulu in Sunam on November 14, party leaders in the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency — held by AAP CM Bhagwant Singh Mann once — were told to reach out to the beneficiaries of the Central welfare schemes and seek their support for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Addressing a press conference on November 16, Jakhar accused the AAP government of “swindling and hijacking Central schemes for the distribution of wheat”, targeting its doorstep delivery of atta programme. He said, “Due to the AAP’s apathy, 1.41 crore beneficiaries who receive wheat under the Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana scheme launched by PM Modi will now get poor quality atta.”',\n",
              "       '‘When we contest, we fight for all. If any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction’: BJP Nathdwara candidatePitted against five-time Congress MLA and Assembly Speaker C P Joshi, BJP’s Vishwaraj Singh, a member of the Mewar royal family who claims descent from legendary Rajput warrior king Maharana Pratap, speaks about the coming polls. Excerpts: Joshi has been in politics for a long time, but over the years, he has earned a reputation which I think will work to my advantage. Also, in the same Nathdwara constituency, we have Shrinathji and Haldighati (the historical battlefield where Maharana Pratap fought Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576). There is a strong bond (between the royal family and the people). This sentiment brings about a feeling of trust, which is often lacking in politics. So yes… The question implies that lineage does not guarantee a good performance. I strongly disagree with this. I understand that the people wanted me and hence the party chose me. I am not making any personal comments against the Congress candidate. It is the general impression about the Congress here. I bring to the table what theBJPhas achieved and what it hopes to in the future. Some of the key issues where I will put in my sincere efforts are increasing payments to farmers and to curb the rising price of petrol, which is the most expensive in the state. I disagree that the Congress has rolled out welfare policies. For four-and-a-half years, they have been squabbling over who is going to be chief minister. Announcements made over the past few months have been done keeping the upcoming elections in mind. Administratively, I do not think any of these decisions were wise. On the one hand, they are decreasing the price of LPG cylinders, but are hiking petrol prices. This is like taking money from the right pocket and keeping it in the left. I don’t want to comment on whether the incident is being used to polarise voters on communal lines. When we contest elections, we fight for all communities. If there has been any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction to the incident and not the result of someone’s deliberate attempt. Also, there is no accountability regarding crimes against women in the state. The government relief in the Kanhaiya Lal case came very late and was not equal to what was given in Jaipur (in case of another killing). I don’t think things are being handled in a fair manner. I see no reason in publicising what I do in my personal life. When it comes to politics, it is about doing something constructive and for people’s benefit. There is an appropriate time for everything. This was the time when I got an opportunity and I thought it would be correct of me to take it up.',\n",
              "       'Cong veteran C P Joshi feels the heat as Maharana Pratap descendant enters the battlefieldThe old haveli at Dabiyon ka Guda, a small village about 15 km from Nathdwara in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan, is bustling with activity. Women in colourful, traditional Rajasthani attires mill around in the courtyard while turbaned men wait outside in anticipation of “Mewarnath” Vishwaraj Singh, who claims descent from legendary warrior king Maharana Pratap and theBJP’s candidate for the upcoming Assembly elections. With Singh in the fray, Nathdwara’s election has turned into a “clash of titans” as he is up against Assembly Speaker and veteran Congress leader C P Joshi. Despite the “crown prince” arriving an hour late for his rally, people welcome him with drumbeats and shower petals on him even as youth among the crowd break into slogans of “Maharana Pratap ki jai”. Women greet him with aarti before he enters the haveli and pays obeisance to the deity in the temple inside. Singh then takes a seat on the platform outside as people, whose names are announced along with their clan, come forward to garland him and touch his feet as a mark of respect. On the personal front, a soft-spoken Singh exhibits humility but the underscoring of Mewari traditions in his campaign is unmistakable. In his address, apart from attacking the Congress on its “misgovernance”, the BJP candidate emphasises to the people that his relationship with them is 1,400 years old and stresses on how people across community lines fought together under Maharana Pratap. Local leaders at the Congress’s campaign office in Nathdwara say Joshi is going village to village to highlight the developmental work that he has undertaken in the constituency. “The BJP has nothing to show for ground work. They are playing the sentiment card and hence their campaign revolves around the Mewar king and Shri Ram,” a Congress leader says. Going into the election, the Congress will also have Joshi’s electoral past in mind. The Assembly Speaker, who has won from Nathdwara five times since 1985, led the party to victory as state president in 2008 but lost his seat by a single vote to the BJP’s Kalyan Singh Chauhan. It is widely believed that Joshi’s aspirations of becoming CM vanished with the defeat. A key factor that is likely to influence the electoral outcome in Nathdwara is the caste composition of the electorate. Rajputs alone make up 30% of the voters while Brahmins are 15%. The BJP, by fielding the Mewar royal, is hoping that the Rajput pride translates into votes in its favour. The preference of candidates based on caste seems to be evident on the ground too. While conceding that Joshi, a Brahmin, has done a lot of work in the constituency, Mahipal Singh, a Rajput, throws his weight behind Vishwaraj Singh. “Nathdwara is more developed than the district headquarters, Rajsamand. Joshi, a tall leader, made the government focus on the constituency. But now Raja (Vishwaraj Singh) is here and the sentiment of the people is attached to him. Joshiji would have won hands down if Vishwaraj Singh was not in the picture. Who knows Raja may settle down here if he wins?” Mahipal Singh says. Many other voters of the Rajput community echo the shopkeeper’s views. A section of Brahmin voters too appear eager to throw their weight behind Vishwaraj Singh. Home guard Manoj Paliwal says people will go with the royal as they hold him in high regard, despite Joshi’s contributions. The pro-royal sentiment, however, wanes among OBCs and tribals, who also make up a significant chunk – around 40% – of the electorate. In Siswi ki Dandi village, where Vishwaraj Singh addresses a gathering of Rehbaris and Salvis – both OBCs – the crowd accords him a grand welcome, but begins speaking of Joshi’s good work moments after he leaves. “Do not go by the way we welcomed him. We are a village of camel herders and have a long association with the royal family. We revere them. The family has historically suffered a lot to keep Islamic rulers at bay,” says Tulsi Ram, who belongs to the Rehbari community, adding: “But we cannot forget the work Joshiji has done for us.” In Semal village, close to the legendary battlefield of Haldighati, where Maharana Pratap faced off against Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576, Kamal Sain says the lingering question is whether Vishwaraj Singh will be available when the people need him. “No one knows the Maharaja. Will he meet us and get our work done? A few years ago, when we needed a school in the village, we asked Joshi, who got orders passed for the school in a day,” Sain, who belongs to the Nai (OBC) community, says. In tribal-dominated Udan village near Nathdwara town, Bhimrai says he doesn’t know the government but is aware of Joshi. Bhimrai, who belongs to the Bhil community, says he will vote for the veteran Congress leader. Joshi, however, is feeling the heat from the BJP. A look at the list of public events to be attended by the BJP and Congress candidates on Monday tells a story. While Vishwaraj Singh was slated to visit 13 places, Joshi was slated to visit 39.',\n",

Given that Purnesh had been unceremoniously shunned out of his ministry months ahead of the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections, the appointment is also being perceived as “redemption” for the leader, if not a “reward” for the case he won against Rahul. Purnesh will hold the post of UT in-charge for three years, and said his primary focus will be to ensure the party’s victory in the upcomingLok Sabhaelections. “I will work with local teams and strengthen the party at the grassroots level (booth level) to ensure electoral benefits for theBJP. We believe power can be attained through a strong organisation. My focus will lie on booth-level political and micro management,” he said. The Dadra & Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat is currently held by Kalaben Delkar, the widow of former seven-time MP Mohan Delkar, who died of suspected suicide in aMumbaihotel in 2021. Delkar, an influential tribal leader, had won the seat as an Independent in 2019, but had later moved to the JD(U). His wife was elected as MP in November 2021 on aShiv Senaticket. The other Lok Sabha seat in the UT is held by the BJP’s Lalu Patel. Delkar’s death had led to consternation in the BJP ranks as the Daman, Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli UT administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, was among the nine people named in the abetment to suicide case. The Bombay High Court had later quashed the case. Khoda Patel was also given additional charge as the Administrator of Lakshadweep. BJP leaders believe that Purnesh’s Gujarati roots will help the party in the two Lok Sabha constituencies, which are geographically connected to Gujarat, especially in the Delkar stronghold of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. “His appointment has spread a positive wave among party leaders and workers. This is the first time that a Gujarati has been appointed as incharge. Local leaders and workers were less interested in working with former incharges like Vinod Sonkar and Vidhya Rahatkar,” senior BJP leader Dipak Jadhav, who has been associated with the party in the region for 33 years, said. An OBC leader, Purnesh was minister for roads in the previous Bhupendra Patel Cabinet before he was stripped of his berth in August 2022. He has been an active member of the BJP inSuratfor over two decades, and he has impressed with his organisational skills as BJP Surat city unit for two terms between 2010 and 2016. He won his first Assembly election in a 2012 bypoll from Surat West, following the demise of sitting MLA Kishor Vankawala. He went on to win the seat again in 2017 and 2022. According to some sources, Purnesh’s appointment might ease his way onto the national scene. Purnesh had filed a criminal defamation case against Rahul Gandhi in a Surat court in 2019 over the Congress leader’s remark implying that all thieves were called Modi, at a rally in Karnataka’s Kolar. On March 23 this year, Chief Judicial Magistrate H H Varma convicted Rahul, leading to his disqualification as a Lok Sabha MP. In August, the Supreme Court stayed the Congress leader’s conviction, following which he was reinstated as an MP. As UT in-charge, Purnesh says he hopes to connect the organisation and the administration. “We cannot interfere with the administration, but can develop a cordial relationship.

Other big announcements include bringing the Vidhan Parishad to Rajasthan “for wider participation,” “stringent legal measures for hate speech” and constitution of “reconciliation and camaraderie committees at the district level to address hatred and enmity between communities.” Releasing the manifesto, party president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “We make only those promises which we can fulfil, be it in the Centre or states,” claiming that the Congress government fulfilled 95 per cent promises of its last manifesto for the state. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that as many as 3.32 crore people had given online and offline suggestions for the ‘Vision 2030’ document, which also became the basis for the party’s manifesto. आज राजस्थान कांग्रेस कार्यालय में कांग्रेस अध्यक्ष श्री@khargeने जनघोषणा पत्र लॉन्च किया।राजस्थान के सतत विकास के लिए कांग्रेस पूरी तरह तैयार हैं।#कांग्रेस_जन_घोषणा_पत्र2#कांग्रेस_फिर_सेpic.twitter.com/RrhcECw5UZ — Rajasthan PCC (@INCRajasthan)November 21, 2023 The Congress’s promise of “stringent legal measures for hate speech” comes at a time when theBJP, which released its manifesto for Rajasthan last week, has promised to set up a special cell to investigate ‘anti-Bharat’ sleeper cells across the state. Among the Congress’s immediate priorities after coming to power, those for farmers include a promise to enact a law to implement theMSP, to be called theMinimum Support PriceGuarantee Act, which will implement the Swaminathan Committee’s recommendations. The government will also provide an interest-free agricultural loan facility of up to Rs 2 lakh to all farmers from cooperative banks and withdraw pending cases against farmers related to their participation in protests. Gehlot said that the government will also form a commission, headed by a high court judge, which will hold a hearing before taking a decision on seizing farmlands. Similarly, at the release of BJP’s manifesto last week, BJP president J P Nadda had claimed that the land of 19,400 farmers has been seized and that the party will formulate a policy to ensure such farmers are compensated. The BJP manifesto had also stated that a notification to ensure that no farmlands are seized will be brought out in addition to an MSP of Rs 2,700 per quintal for wheat. With the Centre not backing the state’s demand of declaring the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) as a national project, the Congress manifesto says that the government will introduce a detailed plan for its staggered implementation. The BJP manifesto did not mention ERCP. For youth, the Congress says it will create 10 lakh employment opportunities in five years, out of which 4 lakh employment opportunities will be in the government sector. Additionally, a new scheme for the recruitment of youngsters at the panchayat level, gradually merging with government vacancies, will also be formulated. Moreover, the government will start a toll-free call centre and an e-Employment Exchange. In comparison, the BJP has promised 2.5 lakh jobs in the next five years as well as the setting up of a Rajasthan Institute of Medical Sciences and Rajasthan Institute of Technology – modelled on AIIMS and IITs – in each division, among several other measures. The Congress has also promised to increase the maximum number of employment days under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Indira Gandhi Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (IGUEGS) to 150 days annually, up from 125 days currently. For women’s safety, the Congress promises it will ensure installation of CCTV cameras in public places and security guards will be appointed in every village and urban ward. The party also promises to take necessary steps to reduce the average investigation time in sexual harassment cases and ensure 33 per cent reservation for women in cooperative institutions as well as in the police force. The BJP too had promised 33 per cent reservation of women in the police force, a women’s police station in every district, constitution of anti-Romeo squads, etc. The Congress also promises to provide a free coupon every month for free travel for women in the state-owned buses, in addition to existing discounts, and says it will come up with a scheme for special leave to be availed by women during their menstrual cycle. The Congress had earlier announced Rs 10,000 per annum for women heads of households while BJP had announced the Lado Protsahan Yojana where the government will provide a savings bond of Rs 2 lakh for a girl child. The Congress has repeated that it will conduct a caste census “to accurately determine population and allocate benefits for informed decisions on affirmative action”. For education, Congress says that it will provide education facilities till Class 12, instead of till Class 8, under the Right to Education (RTE) by bringing an education guarantee law in the state. The party had earlier announced free laptops or tablets for first-year students of government colleges and free English-medium school education. The BJP has promised Rs 1,200 as direct benefit transfer to schoolchildren from economically weaker sections for their school bags, books and uniforms. In the health sector, the Congress government will increase the amount of Mukhyamantri Nishulk Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana from the current Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh annually and also include ‘In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) package’ under this scheme “realising the profound emotional and social challenges faced by couples deprived of the joy of parenthood”. The party has also promised it will increase the facilities under free OPD/IPD in government medical institutions at the district and block levels. The BJP, meanwhile, has promised to launch the Rs 40,000 crore Bhamashah Health Infrastructure Mission to expand and upgrade health infrastructure in the state. It has also promised to set up 350 Jan Aushadi Kendras and at least one medical college in each district. Recruitment of 15,000 doctors and 20,000 paramedical staff along with adding 6,000 medical seats are also among promises made by the BJP in its manifesto. For businessmen, Congress has promised it will bring a ‘Vyapari Credit Card Scheme’, similar to the Kisan Credit Card Scheme, which will provide interest-free loans up to Rs 5 lakh to small traders, shopkeepers and young entrepreneurs. The Gig Workers Welfare Act will be amended to include auto and taxi drivers, “creating a more inclusive welfare system”. For good governance, the party promises to enact an “Accountability and Auto Service Delivery Act” which has been long demanded by social activists in Rajasthan. For LPG gas cylinders, the government had already announced that the Rs 500 subsidised cylinder will be extended to families under the NFSA (National Food Security Act) and BPL (Below Poverty Line) categories too. Now, the price has been reduced to Rs 400. In its manifesto, the BJP had announced cylinders at Rs 450. While Congress says it will implement measures and stringent punishments to curb incidents of paper leaks, BJP had announced it will set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate paper leaks during Congress rule. The Congress party had earlier announced a law to back the Old Pension Scheme with law and strengthen it. Moreover, a Congress government, if elected, will continue its schemes such as smartphones with internet for women. Keeping in mind the reserved castes, Congress says that it will establish an Equal Opportunities Commission “to ensure equal opportunities and fair representation”. Moreover, it will modify the percentage of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in accordance with the actual population to be enumerated in the census. Measures for minorities include drafting and implementation of “a robust Minority Development Policy”. Other announcements include developing an advanced system for predicting air pollution levels, promotion of night tourism in Jaipur, leveraging medical tourism, etc.',\n",
              "       'Decoding Politics: Why Muslim quota is sparking fireworks in Telangana frayIn its campaign for the Telangana Assembly polls, the BJP has repeatedly raised the issue of theexisting Muslim reservation in the state, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah calling it “unconstitutional” while maintaining that it will be abolished if the BJP wins the election. Addressing apoll rally at Jangaonon Monday, Shah said, “BJPis the party of Telangana people. When BJP forms government in Telangana we will abolish the unconstitutional 4% Muslim reservation.” He also repeated the BJP’s pledge to appoint a backward class (BC) leader as the CM if voted to power in the November 30 Assembly polls. Last Saturday, in his speech at a rally in Gadwal, Shah promised to scrap religion-based reservation and increase the quota of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) if the BJP clinches the election. He also accused the Congress and the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) of being “anti-BC” parties while claiming that only the BJP could benefit the backwards. The issue also figured in theBJP’s manifesto released by ShahinHyderabadlast Saturday, which besides several freebies also promised implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). The party’s manifesto, titled “Sakala Janula Saubhagya Telangana (welfare of the people)”, says that it would remove “unconstitutional” religion-based reservation, including the 4% quota for Muslims, in government jobs and seats in state educational institutes. The Muslim quota would be redistributed to OBCs, SCs, and STs, the manifesto states, adding that the party will set up a committee to draft a UCC for the state. On November 9, the Telangana Congress released its “Minority Declaration” for the polls, promising to increase the state annual minority welfare budget to Rs 4,000 crore. The party also pledged to conduct the caste survey within six months of coming to power in the state. The “Minority Declaration” stated that the Congress will ensure fair reservation for all backward classes, including minorities, in jobs, education and government schemes. Soon after Shah first raked up the Muslim quota at a rally at Chevella on the outskirts of Hyderabad in April this year, the Congress as well as the BRS and the AIMIM accused him of “undermining” the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court before which the issue has been pending. Senior Telangana Congress leader and ex-minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir has maintained that the 4% Muslim quota in jobs and education for socially and economically backward Muslims under the BC-E category is being implemented in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh based on the stay granted by the Supreme Court. He has said that the 4% Muslim reservation – announced by the then Y S Rajashekar Reddy government after the Congress stormed to power in the united Andhra Pradesh in 2004 – encompasses only 14 socially and economically backward groups among Muslims, identified by a Backward Classes Commission without affecting the quota of other communities. Shabbir has alleged that the BJP leaders have been attempting to “distort” these points to mislead the public and incite communal hatred. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has charged that Shah’s remarks exposed the BJP’s “double standards”. “On the one hand, Prime Minister Naredra Modi talks of reaching out to backward Muslims like Pasmandas and, on the other, the Union Home Minister announces that they will cancel Muslim reservation,” he said. What had the BJP to offer Telangana bar anti-Muslim “hate speeches”, Owaisi alleged, adding that the BJP-led Centre should instead amend laws to remove the overall 50% quota ceiling. BRS spokesperson Ravula Sridhar Reddy said Shah’s statement was another sign that “the BJP is greedy to grab power by any means”. “Amit Shah has turned the Muslim quota into a religious issue. He does not know the difference between constitutional and unconstitutional quota because the 4% quota is constitutional and does not breach the 50% ceiling,” Reddy said. In April 2017, in keeping with a poll promise, the BRS government led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR passed a Bill to increase quota for STs from 6% to 10%, and for Muslims from 4% to 12%, which would breach the 50% ceiling. But the Bill remains stuck as the Centre has not cleared it.',\n",
              "       'Trouble in Karnataka BJP as senior leaders revolt over Yediyurappa’s continuing gripAt least some prominent leaders of Karnataka BJP are unhappy that former chief minister and party Parliamentary board member B S Yediyurappa is back in the driver’s seat of the state unit, havinginstalled his son and first-time MLA B Y Vijayendra as its president, as well asloyalist R Ashoka as Leader of Opposition (LoP)in the state Assembly. Over the past week,BJPMLAs Basangouda Patil Yatnal and Arvind Bellad, as well as former state ministers C T Ravi and Arvind Limbavali, have criticised these appointments. Yatnal, who has a history of lashing out at Yediyurappa and Vijayendra, said he had informed the central observers about “those who were disloyal to the party” and made “adjustments” with the Opposition during the Assembly polls earlier this year. It was a barb aimed at the Yediyurappa camp, against which the camp led by BJP general secretary B L Santhosh had also made similar allegations after the BJP’s dismal show at the polls. In fact, a majority of the leaders and workers who have expressed their unhappiness about the new appointments are from the Santhosh camp. “The BJP should not become a party of one family. Workers won’t accept it,” Yatnal said on Friday, after he had walked out of the BJP Legislature Party meeting along with MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi, in which, earlier in the day, Ashoka had been elected as the LoP. Like Yatnal, Bellad was an aspirant for the LoP post. At the Legislature Party meeting, he had argued that having an LoP from North Karnataka would help the BJP win more seats there in theLok Sabhaelections. But that was not to be. He, though, welcomed Ashoka’s appointment, “keeping party interests in mind”. Both Yatnal and Bellad are from the dominant Lingayat community and form a majority in North Karnataka. Yatnal, a firebrand leader, has cultivated a large following among the Panchamasali subsect of the Lingayats, since their agitations in 2021 and 2022, demanding 2B reservation for the community. Last week, Limbavali, who has been the BJP general secretary several times, said party members were asking if Vijayendra had any qualification to be appointed as state president, other than being Yediyurappa’s son. Jarkiholi is another senior state BJP leader who is known to harbour reservations about Vijayendra, after their relationship turned sour during the former’s tenure as minister in the Yediyurappa Cabinet. Though there are fears that sidelining these leaders could be counterproductive, party leaders dismissed these, claiming that come the Lok Sabha polls, everyone would be found working for the party’s success. Trying to calm the swirling speculations of disgruntlement, Vijayendra on Sunday said Yatnal’s remarks had been misinterpreted. “He is free to express his opinions… He might have aired his grievances. We will find a solution, in consultation with seniors and national leaders,” he said. Speaking toThe Indian Express, BJP MLC Chalavady Narayanaswamy said he expected a compromise to be reached soon. “There won’t be any major impact on the party. Vijayendra has started taking everyone into confidence,” he said.',\n",

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Congress in-charge for Rajasthan Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, state party president Govind Singh Dotasra, manifesto committee chairman C P Joshi and ex-deputy CM Sachin Pilot will release “Jan Ghoshna Patra” at the state party office in Jaipur. During their campaigns, CM Gehlot and other Congress leaders have announced the party’s seven poll “guarantees”, which include Rs 10,000 per annum honorarium for women heads of families, subsidised gas cylinders at Rs 500 for over 1 crore households, free laptops or tablets for first-year students studying in government colleges, free English medium school education, purchase of dung from cattle owners at Rs 2 per kg, Rs 15 lakh calamity insurance for Chiranjeevi families, and a pledge to back the old pension scheme (OPS) for government employees with a law. TheBJPhas already released its manifesto on November 16, which has pledged various welfare schemes for women, youth and students. It has also promised to form a special police cell for probing “anti-Bharat” sleeper cells. Modi rallies and roadshow In Rajasthan, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiwill address two public meetings Tuesday — at Anta town in Baran and at Dusshera Ground in Kota. Union Minister and BJP Rajasthan in-charge Pralhad Joshi toured Anta and Kota on Monday and supervised preparations for the PM’s rallies. “It will be our largest public meeting in the history of Kota. People from nine Assembly seats in Kota and Bundi are expected to attend the public meeting at Dusshera Ground,” Joshi said. PM Modi will also hold a roadshow in Jaipur on Tuesday evening. The PM’s roadshow will be held inside the walled city of Jaipur and will start from Sanganeri gate, before moving through Bapu Bazaar, Nehru Bazaar, Kishanpole Bazaar, Choti Chaupad, Trilpolia Bazaar, Badi Chaupad and Johari Bazaar before ending at Sanganeri Gate in the city. Rahul rally Congress leader andWayanadMPRahul Gandhiwill address a public meeting in Udaipur district in Rajasthan. This rally will be held in Vallabhnagar Assembly constituency, where a triangular contest is expected between the Congress’s Preeti Gajendra Shekhawat, the BJP’s Udaylal Dangi and Deepinder Kunwar, wife of former Janata Sena Party MLA Randhir Singh Bhinder. Last Thursday, addressing his first rallies in Rajasthan — in Churu, Hanumangarh, and Ganganagar districts — in this election season, Rahul praised the welfare schemes of the Gehlot government with a promise of seven more, while warning that if the BJP is elected to power here, it will pull down the welfare net stitched by his party, as Hamza Khan reported. Repolling in MP booth Repolling will take place at a booth in Ater Assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district Tuesday, in accordance with the Election Commission of India (ECI)’s order. Voting will be held at booth number 3 of the polling centre number 71 at Kishupura between 7 am and 6 pm, the ECI order said. A district official said repolling was ordered as there was a breach in secrecy in the concerned booth after some people had shot videos of voting. Jarange-Patil on CM Shinde’s turf Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange-Patil will hold a rally in Thane, the bastion of Maharashtra Chief MinisterEknath Shinde. The announcement of his visit was made by the Sakal Maratha Samaj. Jarange-Patil’s visit comes close on the heels of an all-party OBC Elgar rally held to protest against the demand for inclusion of Marathas in the OBC category. The meeting saw state civil supplies minister and NCP MLA Chaggan Bhujbal steal the show, deploying rhetoric that no one from the ruling NDA has so far used since the Maratha agitation was reignited on August 29, as reported by Manoj Dattatrye More. Much of Bhujbal’s attack was reserved for Jarange-Patil, who has been spearheading the community’s demand for reservation. The Maratha activist’s visit to Thane is a part of his statewide tour, scheduled to culminate on December 24, the deadline set by him for the Shinde government to give Kunbi certificates for members of the Maratha community from across the state. AIADMK brainstorms for 2024 LS polls AIADMK chief Edappadi K Palaniswami or EPS will chair a meeting of district secretaries, office-bearers and other senior functionaries of the party to take stock of the preparations for the 2024Lok Sabhaelections. The high-level meeting to be held at the AIADMK headquarters will review preparations at all levels, starting from the booth committees. The move assumes significance as the party is holding such a meeting for the first time since exiting the NDA in September. Earlier this month, the ruling DMK concluded its zone-wise special meetings for its booth agents.

              "       'Decoding Politics: 5 reasons why ‘Indiramma’ has returned to TelanganaBharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, popularly known as KCR, has attacked the Congress by criticising the rule of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ahead of the November 30 Assembly polls. This was after party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra praised the former PM’s record at party rallies, particularly on tribal rights, and invoked her legacy to garner support. Why Indira? While campaigning in the tribal-dominated regions of Asifabad and Khanapur constituencies on November 19, Priyanka invoked the former PM’s legacy on her birth anniversary. She said people in Telangana still affectionately called Indira Gandhi “Indiramma”, 40 years after her death, adding that she gave the region’s Adivasis rights over their “jal, jangal, zameen (water, forests, land)”. “Many leaders would come and go. Many leaders worked for you. But why do you remember Indiraji? Why do you still call her Indiramma? The reason for that… she gave you land rights. Indira Gandhi understood the problems of the poor and distributed seven lakh acres of land to landless poor. She created the Integrated Tribal Development Authority and built lakhs of houses under the tribal sub-plan. She respected your culture and used to tell us how divine your culture is,” Priyanka said, in a reference to the land reforms initiated under Indira as PM. After she had lost from Rae Bareli in the post-Emergency 1977Lok Sabhaelections, Indira decided to contest from two seats in 1980, including Medak in present-day Telangana, with the Congress seeking to consolidate its hold in the South. While she won Medak by a margin of 2.95 lakh votes, in the united Andhra Pradesh, the Congress won 41 Lok Sabha seats out of 42. Indira was the Medak MP at the time of her assassination in 1984. The Congress has also named several of its current promised schemes after her, including programmes targeting women, below-poverty-line families and farmers. KCR’s counter In a string of recent public meetings, the BRS chief and Telangana CM has claimed that Indira Gandhi’s tenure was marked by starvation deaths, a growing Naxalite movement, and extra-judicial killings. At a rally in the Nagarkurnool constituency on Sunday, KCR reiterated the same. “The Congress is promising to bring Indiramma rajyam in Telangana. Do you know what happened under her rule? There were starvation deaths, the Naxalite movement started all over the country, and people were shot dead in fake encounters. Congress party failed to provide even basic drinking water in the country during their decades of rule. Even though rivers are flowing through this region, Congress failed to provide water. On what basis are they asking for votes now?” he said. The ‘starvation’ claim According to KCR, there was hunger in unified Andhra Pradesh under Congress and it was not until N T Rama Rao of the Telugu Desam Party came to power and offered rice at Rs 2 per kg that the starvation situation began to change. KCR was earlier a leader of the TDP. “It was a life of hunger and starvation till then. People should see what development under Congress in the last 50 years was and compare it with the BRS’s development in the last nine years,” the BRS chief said. “The progress Telangana has made since 2014 would be lost under Indiramma rajyam.” Among the BRS’s promises for the upcoming Assembly polls is for all ration card holders to be provided 5 kg of fortified rice through public distribution system (PDS) shops instead of normal rice. The Telangana angle On Monday, speaking at Manakondur Assembly constituency in Karimnagar district, KCR accused the Congress of merging Telangana with Andhra Pradesh (in the 1950s) “against the people’s will”. “There is no regime worse than Indiramma and Congress is promising to bring back those days. It was a time of scams and scandals and looting of public wealth. The Congress merged Telangana with Andhra Pradesh against the will of Telangana people due to which we have suffered for over 50 years,” he said. Under the State Reorganisation Act, 1956, several state boundaries had been redrawn and new states created along linguistic divisions. At the time the Telugu-speaking Andhra Pradesh was carved out of the Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu). A decade later in 1969, there was the first agitation for a separate Telangana state, which turned violent with clashes between protesting youth and the state Congress government. The movement was quashed, but more than 300 were estimated killed. Finally, the Congress-led UPA government would clear the creation of Telangana in 2014. The Narasimha Rao aspect Even while repeatedly attacking Indira and her legacy, the BRS has in recent years praised former PM P V Narasimha Rao, projecting him as a ‘son of the soil’. In 2020, the BRS had turned his 100th birth anniversary into a year-long celebration. KCR even wrote to PMNarendra Modirequesting him to bestow the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, on Narasimha Rao. These efforts were seen as attempts to push ‘Telangana pride’ and claim the Congress leader as a local icon. In June 2021, KCR unveiled a 26-foot tall statue of the former PM at P V Gnana Bhoomi on Necklace Road inHyderabad. Earlier this year, on Narasimha Rao’s 102nd birth anniversary, KCR credited the former PM with introducing the large-scale financial reforms in the early 1990s. “P V Narasimha Rao laid the foundation for India to become a modern country, and he had great political acumen and good governance skills,” KCR said. KCR’s focus on him contrasts with the Congress’s ambivalence regarding Narasimha Rao, who had strained ties with the Gandhi family. Lately, the Congress has been trying to reclaim Rao as its own, and its manifesto for this election says that if it comes to power, the party would name a district after the former PM, who was born in Warangal district.',\n",
              "       'Road to 2024: Hindutva plus welfare emerges as BJP pitch for polls, Congress not far behindWith polling in three states over and two more to go in the next 10 days, the campaign in this set of Assembly elections has been all about two issues – polarisation and welfare politics, with a clear divide. If polarisation seemed to be working for parties in urban areas, the discourse in the rural parts has been dominated by welfare initiatives. TheBJP, which is trying to wrest power in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, retain it in Madhya Pradesh and emerge as a significant electoral force in southern Telangana, has been as enthusiastic as other parties in promising schemes, which it earlier dismissed as “revdis” by the Opposition. (In the fifth state, Mizoram, the BJP remains a marginal figure.) This stress on schemes is especially true of Madhya Pradesh, where his women-oriented announcements are the main hope of its four-term Chief MinisterShivraj Singh Chouhan. Senior Congress leader and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar has even accused Prime MinisterNarendra Modiof “stealing” the Congress’s idea of giving guarantees – which was one big factor in the Congress win in Karnataka. In Chhattisgarh, where the campaign revolved around Hindutva issues on both the BJP and Congress side, the BJP unveiled several promises just four days ahead of the first phase of polling on November 7 – including cooking gas cylinders at Rs 500 for poor families, and Rs 12,000 per year financial assistance to married women. Party sources claim there has been instant positive reaction to the promises, bringing the BJP back in contention in the state. One indication of this was the reaction of the Congress and its fully confident CM Bhupesh Baghel, who within a week of the BJP’s announcements said a Congress government would give Rs 15,000 a year to all women if voted back to power. The BJP has the Karnataka example before it, where its campaign constantly talking of Bajrang Bali could not hold back the Congress momentum, which rode on its poll guarantees, including taking action against divisive outfits. BJP leaders say their calculation is that the party’s last-mile aggressive campaign, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took away JD(S) votes rather than the Congress’s. Not that Hindutva issues have been off the table this time. Addressing a rally in Raghogarh, Madhya Pradesh, recently, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said: “Do you want to have darshan of Ram Lalla or not?… You don’t worry about the expenses. Vote for the BJP and the party government will help you have darshan of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya free.” In Chhattisgarh, he talked of how the state was “Lord Ram’s maternal home”, with Kaushalya believed to have been born there. Shah kept reminding that PM Modi will inaugurate the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22, and said the BJP would introduce a Ram Lalla Darshan Yojana if it comes to power in the state. The Baghel government has a Ram Van Gaman Path project, tracing the route Ram is said to have taken in exile. In Rajasthan, the BJP has promised LPG cylinders at Rs 450 and free Scooty for meritorious Class 12 girls. Under the Lado Protsahan Yojana, the government has said a BJP government would set up a savings bond of Rs 2 lakh for a girl child. In Telangana too, the BJP has promised free travel to Ayodhya. In Madhya Pradesh too, the Congress’s undeclared CM candidate Kamal Nath has been walking the Hindutva thin line, to deny the BJP any advantage on the issue. Kamal Nath, who also announced a Ram Van Gaman Path project that later got stalled when his government fell, said that if voted to power, the Congress will ensure that a project to construct a Sita temple in Sri Lanka is revived. With the Congress showing willingness to engage with the Hindutva issue, mixed with its welfare politics, the BJP has been forced to follow suit. Before the current round of Assembly elections, the party promised free LPG cylinders for women in BPL families, and Rs 25,000 for pregnant women etc in Himachal Pradesh. Ahead of the Gujarat elections, the Centre announced two free LPG cylinders under the PM’s Ujjawala Scheme. It has tried to differentiate these from the Congress’s promises, claiming that its schemes are meant to “empower” women. But, BJP insiders admit: “Karnataka proved that guarantee schemes can sway votes… With economic issues increasingly taking the centrestage in elections, welfare politics and freebies are here to stay… Plus, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan where more than 90% of the population is Hindu, communal polarisation has its limits.” A leader added that the trend of such schemes may continue. “Hindutva issues may have some impact on a small section of the population, that too in urban or semi-urban areas. With price rise and unemployment back in the electoral politics discourse, the BJP cannot be seen as hesitant to announce popular sops even in theLok Sabhaelections.”',\n",
              "       'West Bengal ex-Advocate General: ‘It was a challenge to receive timely instructions (from govt) … could have achieved lot more with full support’Soumendra Nath Mookherjee resigned as West Bengal’s Advocate General on November 10, after just over two years in the position. Mookherjee took over from Kishore Dutta in September 2021. According to government insiders, under him, the government faced several setbacks in the courts which precipitated his departure. In an e-mail interview, Mookherjee discusses the circumstances leading to his resignation and his tenure as the government’s top legal adviser, and answers if he received sufficient support from the state administration. Though I did not tell the state government or any of its officials that I wanted to resign, during my absence from the country a news website reported that I had informed the government I wanted to resign and I was also informed by several lawyers that this was what was being suggested by the government. As the government did not contradict the report, I thought it proper on my part to forthwith tender my resignation to the honourable Governor. The most challenging part was the sheer volume and the diverse problems that arose in the day-to-day administration of the state on which my advice was sought and also the diverse issues in litigations involving the state. I was aware of the challenges and pressure that one could expect while holding this constitutional post. To my mind, I was clear that I had to seamlessly undertake my duties as the Advocate General and stay true to my role as an officer of the court. My caseload, often with insufficient assistance, was immense. I never shied away from an intensive work schedule. However, considering the criticality of several of the matters, the pressure to ensure the welfare objectives of the state were not adversely affected was considerable, especially on account of the sheer amount of fact-finding I had to undertake. Not always. Of course, there were some lawyers and officials who were diligent, thorough, capable, and dedicated, and would always be there to assist me. In important matters involving crores of rupees, or key matters affecting important state interests, I often found that on several occasions there were no state panel lawyers ready and available to assist me. Even the panel was changed without any consultation with me or taking any inputs or suggestions. It was a challenge to receive instructions on a timely and complete basis, and my office had to follow up multiple times to get information well into the early hours of the morning. The state government faced criticism and was snubbed by the Calcutta High Court in several cases. What was the reason? Cases where this happened would be where directions of the High Court had not been complied with within the time limits prescribed. It cannot be expected that the state government will always follow my advice in all matters. I am a lawyer and my advice will always be as per the law and my opinion will be irrespective of the preferences of the powers that be. Of course, the government may have its priorities – by which they may have to balance political goals. So, on several occasions, my advice, even if sought and given, may not have been followed in totality. Previous Advocate Generals have had, and have cited, different reasons for their resignations. I am not privy to the exact reasons or motivations. For me, the bottom line is that any professional should maintain their dignity and self-respect in the profession. To ensure this, I resigned. No, in fact, I made this clear in the meeting with His Excellency, the Hon’ble Governor of West Bengal last week. I will remember it as one of the highlights of my career but one where I feel a lot more could have been achieved if I had the full support of the state government. I have received overwhelming support from the Bar and the judiciary. I have always sought to uphold the dignity of the institution and tried to ensure that justice is delivered and is accessible to all.',\n",
              "       'IUML leader drops in for Pinarayi govt’s all-state splash, sparks off fresh buzz about Cong allyThe smoke and mirrors game between the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress in Kerala, and the ruling CPI (M) has now spilled over into the Pinarayi Vijayan’s Cabinet-on-Wheels programmes being held across the state. On Sunday, local IUML leader A N Aboobacker defied the Congress-led UDF’s call for a boycott of the meetings, dubbed ‘Nava Kerala Sadas’ and took part in a meeting hosted by the Chief Minister in Kasaragod. This was after Vijayan had criticised the Congress but pointedly kept silent on the IUML for Opposition parties not attending the Sadas, which are officially a government initiative to get public feedback on its functioning. The Congress-CPI(M) shadow war over the IUML may get worse in the coming few days, as the Nava Kerala Sadas traverse through the League stronghold districts of North Kerala. CPI(M) state secretary M V Govindan Monday said leaders from any party or alliance, including the UDF, were welcome to attend the Sadas. “Anyone and everyone can come, no matter which political party or alliance they belong to,” he said. Earlier, IUML legislator A Abdul Hameed embarrassed the Congress when he accepted the LDF government’s offer to become a member of the board of directors of the CPI(M)-controlled Kerala Cooperative Bank. This appointment came even as some IUML leaders, led by MLA U A Latheef, are entangled in a legal battle against the merger of the UDF-controlled Malappuram District Cooperative Bank with Kerala Bank. A division bench of the high court is slated to hear their pleas on December 4. When Kerala Bank was constituted by the previous LDF government in 2019, 13 out of the 14 district banks had agreed to merge with it. However, the Malappuram district panchayat, where the IUML is considered influential, held out. The group of IUML leaders who have moved court against the merger met state president Panakkad Syed Sadiqali Shihab Thangal and other senior leaders over the issue on Sunday. Party leader and advocate K Askar Ali, one of the petitioners, said the group shared its concerns with the party leadership over Hameed joining Kerala Bank. “Thangal gave us a go-ahead with the case and offered us full support. Hameed becoming a board member of Kerala Bank will not dissuade us from fighting the case,” Ali said. IUML state general secretary P M A Salam said the party had given its consent to Hameed’s move considering his experience in the cooperative sector. Though Salam exuded confidence that Hameed’s move will not affect the UDF in any way, pro-IUML social media handles have dubbed him as a leader who has betrayed the party. Shibu Baby John, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader and former minister, said the IUML should have examined the political situation before nominating Hameed as a board member. The RSP is also a part of the UDF. “The decision (to nominate Hameed) is right technically but issues in the cooperative sector should have been considered. It shows the political bankruptcy of the CPI(M), which is now trying to woo the IUML,” John said. Congress quarters also noted that Vijayan did not mention IUML legislator A K M Ashraf but slammed the Congress for giving the Nava Kerala Sadas a miss in the Manjeshwar constituency of Kasaragod district on Saturday. “The local MLA would not want to go into hiding when people of his constituency are thronging the programme. I do not want to blame his party (IUML) as he acted in accordance with the decision taken by the Congress,” the CM said. Vijayan did the same at Kasaragod, where IUML legislator N A Nellikkunnu stayed away from the Sadas. “I can understand the mental state of the MLAs who could not participate in the Sadas due to the (Congress) boycott,” he said. It was on the second day of the programme at Kasaragod that Aboobacker defied his party IUML’s public stand and participated in the CM’s interactions. “It is my responsibility to take up issues of the people with the Cabinet. I find the Sadas a venue to highlight issues. I do not know about the boycott,” Aboobacker claimed. The speeches being made by CPI (M) leaders and state Cabinet members at these interactions are also being watched closely. Their constant references to ‘‘threat by theBJP’’ is seen as their way of projecting that they are the only party that can take on the BJP, and that the Congress is not in the fight. Amidst the confusion over the new affiliations, senior IUML leader and MLA K P A Majeed told his party members to recall the party’s declaration. “In 1974, IUML leader P M S Pookoya Thangal had made the party’s stand clear on the Communist party. Those were the days when a section of the party was keen to shelter Communists, but Thangal categorically refused to have an alliance with any Marxist party. That declaration is still strong and there is no ground to change it,” said Majeed.',\n",
              "       'Akhilesh Yadav went in all guns blazing into MP, hopes to make a bangStung by what it calls betrayal by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh — where the national party ignored the Samajwadi Party’s (SP’s) call for alliance in the Assembly polls — party president Akhilesh Yadav led an aggressive campaign in the state, in a bid to hold on to its workers and to raise its bargaining power with the Congress for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls within the Opposition INDIA bloc. A belligerent Akhilesh, responding to media queries on alliance for the 2024Lok Sabhapolls, said, “Any discussion on an alliance will happen when the Lok Sabha elections are at hand.” The SP chief also attacked the Congress by saying there was no difference in principles and programmes between it and theBJP. SP leaders in MP admitted that the top leadership of the party has never been as involved in campaigning in the state in the past Assembly polls, with Akhilesh Yadav himself addressing 24 public rallies across 20 Assembly seats, besides leading “rath yatras” in three others. His wife and Mainpuri MP Dimple Yadav too joined the campaign and addressed rallies to ensure better connect with women voters. It was the first time she had campaigned outside UP. The couple also visited temples to pray for the victory of party candidates. Not only that. Akhilesh also sent his uncle and SP general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav, and cousinDharmendraYadav, to campaign in MP constituencies bordering UP. Sudhakar Singh, a Thakur, who was recently elected the SP MLA from Ghosi in Mau district of UP, was deployed in Deotalab Assembly area of MP, along with senior UP OBC leaders Ram Achal Rajbhar and Lalji Verma. Earlier this year, Sudhakar’s bypoll win was projected as a victory of the INDIA bloc, with all its constituents, including the Congress, supporting the SP candidate. SP Madhya Pradesh president Ramayan Singh Patel later claimed that the aggressive campaign would damage Congress chances in at least 25 Assembly seats. He added that the top SP leadership campaigned a lot more this time because its local organisation was in a good position and was prepared to field candidates on more seats than in 2018. The SP has fielded 72 candidates this year, compared to 52 in 2018, when it had won one. Another party leader, though, said Akhilesh campaigned hard because the party unit in MP was confronted with an existential question, adding that the party had planned to contest 5-6 seats at a time it was holding alliance talks with the Congress. “Our workers, who had wanted to contest on other seats, had decided to stay neutral because the SP was not going to field them in case the alliance fructified. Some of them even joined other parties. When the Congress refused to ally at the last moment, the SP had only 15 days to put up a fight. Still, the top leaders camped in MP for several days to carry out an aggressive campaign, holding dialogues with workers. Certain remarks by state Congress chief Kamal Nath also hurt Akhilesh personally.” The SP leader also added that holding on to party workers was necessary ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “In case the Congress again refuses to ally for the Lok Sabha polls, the SP will be prepared to contest in Madhya Pradesh alone. For that, the party needed to maintain organisational strength on the ground,” he said. “If the SP goes on to win some seats in MP, or even manages to display its strength by damaging the Congress’s chances on some seats, its bargaining power for the Lok Sabha polls in UP and seats in MP bordering UP will increase,” said the leader. Party spokesperson Udayveer Singh said, “After the Congress betrayed us in MP, the party had to work hard to keep its workers united; also because we believe in contesting every election with complete dedication.”',\n",
              "       'Bathinda mayor ouster sparks buzz on Sukhbir, Manpreet equation as Warring pulls off a coupThe ouster of the Congress-ruled Bathinda Municipal Corporation’s first woman mayor Raman Goyal through a no-confidence motion has brought the relations between Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and his estranged cousin and ex-finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal back into focus in Punjab political circles. A loyalist of Manpreet, Goyal was expelled by the Congress in February this year. A month earlier, Manpreet, the former Bathinda urban MLA, had quit the Congress to join theBJP, which was described as “good riddance” by the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC)’s president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. Both Manpreet and Warring had been at loggerheads for long even during the former’s stint in the Congress. Warring’s campaign pitch during the February 2022 Assembly polls was, “Sare Badal hara deo… (Defeat all Badals).” Thirty-one of the 50 councillors of the Bathinda civic body were present for the no-confidence motion against Goyal on November 15, in which four SAD councillors joined their 26 Congress counterparts to vote her out of her office. Stung by the development, Sukhbir ordered the expulsion of his councillors from the party. Seizing on the Akali Dal chief’s crackdown on his councillors, Warring, who is believed to have led the oust-Goyal operation, said, “Akali councillors were being asked to help the Manpreet Badal camp, but still 4 of them voted against the mayor, following which they were expelled… This again proves that both Badals are actually together despite belonging to different parties, which I have been saying for a long time.” Hitting back at Warring, Manpreet, while speaking toThe Indian Express, charged: “It is Warring who has been operating as the ‘B team’ of AAP Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann in lieu of personal benefits. I have said earlier too how Warring has been in cahoots with Bhagwant Mann at the expense of his Congress party and his associates. Warring’s silence over the arrest of fellow Congressman Sukhpal Singh Khaira (in a 2015 drug case) is a testimony to it.” Manpreet, who had initially been with the Akali Dal, also said that the removal of the Bathinda mayor was “another attack on Punjab’s interests”. However, Harinder Singh Dhillon, one of the SAD councillors who joined hands with the Congress against the mayor, said, “This no-confidence motion was bound to happen as the House is dominated by Congress councillors. How could a mayor who had already been expelled by her Congress party continue in her post in such a situation. Goyal has not joined BJP but she has openly been a Manpreet loyalist.” The election to the 50-ward Bathinda civic body was held in February 2021, in which the Congress bagged 43 seats with the Akali Dal winning the remaining seven. Manpreet, who was the finance minister in the then Congress-led government, lobbied successfully with the party leadership to ensure Goyal’s election as the mayor, even though the then Congress councillor Jagroop Singh Gill was eyeing the post and even protested against this decision. A five-time councillor, Gill defected to the AAP in August 2021. Subsequently, in the Assembly polls, the AAP fielded Gill from the Bathinda urban constituency, where he defeated the incumbent MLA Manpreet by over 68,000 votes. Sarup Chand Singla was the SAD’s candidate from the Bathinda urban seat. Following the poll results, Singla quit the Akali Dal amid swirling allegations that his bid against Manpreet was “sabotaged” from within the party. Singla had himself expressed such concerns during his campaign. When Manpreet switched to the BJP, Goyal along with several councillors openly expressed their loyalty towards him, following which the Congress expelled her along with four other councillors. Dhillon said, “When Goyal was chosen as the mayor, Gill protested…we had taken a stand in his favour even then. Later, the people of Bathinda chose Gill over Manpreet despite the fact that he had got many works done in urban areas. We supported the no-confidence motion against the mayor rising above politics as everything is not for political gains. If pardhan ji (Sukhbir) has to take action against us, what can we do. We still stand by our decision.” Although the Congress continues to be in a majority in the Bathinda Municipal Corporation, its tally has dropped to 30 due to a series of defections and expulsions since 2021, with the civic body’ next election scheduled for February 2026.',\n",
              "       'In her bastion, Vasundhara has her base but many ask who’s nextThe Hadoti region, still bearing remnants of the Bundi kingdom, has always been a stronghold of the BJP in Rajasthan. Both its stalwarts Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the first non-Congress chief minister of the state, and Vasundhara Raje won from this region. Shekhawat first won the Chhabra seat in 1977, and Raje has been representing Jhalrapatan for 20 years now. In this election too, theBJPappears to have an edge in the region, which has 17 Assembly seats spread across districts such as Kota, Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar. However, the excitement is muted and there’s no perceptible wave, similar to other regions of the state. There are two reasons for this. One is the absence of palpable anger on the ground against current CM Ashok Gehlot; there is appreciation for his government’s schemes and social justice initiatives but tinged by resentment against sitting MLAs, including the Congress’s. The second reason is the uncertainty over Raje’s place in the state BJP. “Woh hamare liye sab kuchch hain(She is everything for us). Raje is the only leader in the BJP who can make a claim to the CM post as of now,” says Rakesh Meena, a small businessman at Dara Station. “Everyone in my village talks about her. Our city looks like this because of the development works she has done. For us women also, she will be good,” adds Sonia Saini, a housewife. Rambabu, the priest at the Sadguru Kabir Ashram in Jhalrapatan, also credits all the local developmental projects, such as railway lines, medical college, cricket stadium, bus depot, to Raje. “Jhalrapatan is ahead of every town in the state only because of her,” he says. Raje clearly remains the tallest BJP leader in the region, appreciated for her “decision-making” and “strong leadership”, with her royal lineage an added plus. Her gradual eclipsing in the state BJP leadership hasn’t escaped the people, nor has her absence from party programmes, or the delay in announcing her candidature and that of her supporters. Incidentally, support for Raje has helped the BJP retain its influence in the Hadoti region even when other parts of the state voted for the Congress. In 2013, the BJP won 16 of the 17 seats from the region; in 2018, when the Congress came to power, it won 7 from here, but the BJP still got 10. The Gehlot government’s Rs 1,200-crore Heritage Chambal River Front Project in Kota is one way the Congress is trying to make its way into the region. Some Raje supporters like Rakesh Meena are keeping their fingers crossed and say that everything hangs on the post-poll scenario. “We know she is not a favourite of the BJP leadership, but she will change the game after the elections,” he says. Jehangir Patan, a truck driver and a resident of Jhalrapatan, adds: “This is Madam’s raj. Even if they don’t make her the CM, this will continue to be her raj.” At the same time, there are other BJP supporters who are looking ahead, reconciled to the possibility that Raje may not head a BJP government should the party win the November 25 election. “There are too many leaders in the BJP, the central leadership may not make her the CM. But it’s also a fact that people vote for the BJP because of Modiji now,” says G L Gaur, a retired government employee in Kota, adding that he has been a BJP supporter since its Jana Sangh days in the 1970s. Another ardent BJP supporter, Pavan Kumar, who sells kachoris by the roadside at Dara, says that while Raje is “the natural choice”, and that “the public only knows her”, “it’s the party’s decision. What can we do about it? Let’s see who it chooses.” Several names have been doing the rounds, pushed by different BJP camps as surveys give the party a good chance of winning. “We heard about Baba Balaknath and (Union minister) Gajendra Shekhawat. But Balaknath has to win his own seat (Tijara); he is having a tough time and could not even campaign in other constituencies. Shekhawat is not even contesting (in the elections),” says Mukesh Chawda in Bundi town. Ravi Dutt Sharma and Raghunandan Singh, retired government employees and residents of Haveli Katkaun, dismiss suggestions other than Raje. “We used to say, ‘Zindagi Jhalawar ho gayi’ to say life is in the gutter. But Raje uplifted Jhalawar,” Singh says. On the other two contenders, he adds: “Gajendra Singh (Shekhawat) is not known in this side of the state… We have not seen Balaknath.Sirf naam se koi Yogi nahin bante hein. Daadi banane se koi Modi nahi banta hai(Just because he is a Mahant, doesn’t make him Yogi Adityanath. Just because someone has a beard, that doesn’t make him Modi).” Balaknath, who belongs to the Nath religious sect like Adityanath, is fashioning himself as Yogi No.2, the image drawing as much on both being religious leaders, as on the UP CM’s reputation for being strict on law and order. Saying that Raje’s sidelining could impact the BJP’s showing, S Nagendra Ambedkar, Professor of Public Policy, Central University of Rajasthan, adds: “It all depends on the message she gives to voters in and around the Hadoti region. If it’s a negative message, the BJP will face an adverse impact. But if she keeps their hopes alive, it will not affect the party so badly.” Raje has been very careful about this, not making any remarks in public about the CM post nor party decisions. When her recent remark “I feel I can retire now”, while talking about the progress made by her son Dushyant, a three-term MP, was interpreted as a sign that she was ready to call it a day, Raje clarified immediately that she would continue in active politics and that retirement was never on her agenda. “She is being very careful. She is keeping the option open for the party leadership also,” a BJP leader involved with the state party functioning says. In fact, the two-term CM is the only state BJP leader who has been criss-crossing the state addressing rallies and doing road shows. Since the elections were announced, Raje has already visited at least 28 constituencies. Her supporters say that her absence from recent party programmes was only because she was not invited to the same. Then there are others who feel Raje should take her cue to exit, which usually does not come easy to politicians. Arvind Kumar, a hardcore BJP supporter and a businessman near Bundi Fort, says: “Raje has had her time. She should hang up her boots now. Let the youngsters take over.”',\n",
              "       'Why Gulab Chand Kataria’s ‘quiet return’ made noise in UdaipurMore than a month after Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot targeted Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar over his frequent visits to the state in the run-up to the Assembly elections, a similar controversy appears to rage in Udaipur as Congress leaders take on Assam Governor Gulab Chand Kataria over his extended stay in the city of lakes with days to go for the polls. Kataria, who was until recently the longest-serving MLA of Udaipur City and the Leader of Opposition, was spotted leaving the home of city Mayor G S Tank on November 13. According toBJPinsiders, Kataria met the party’s city councillors and leaders there. While the BJP maintained that Kataria had come to exchange Diwali greetings with party workers and leaders, the Congress accused the governor of electioneering despite holding a constitutional post. Congress’s Udaipur candidate and All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the governor must resign before touring Udaipur. It echoed Gehlot’s criticism of Dhankhar when the CM said there was “no logic” in the vice president visiting the state frequently during elections. Last week, Vallabh even shot off a letter to the Election Commission (EC) to complain about Kataria’s presence in Udaipur. Responding to the criticism, Kataria toldThe Indian Express, “I have been a representative of the people of Udaipur for 40 years. If on Diwali I come home and people meet me at my residence, what’s wrong with that? I have worked with these party workers for decades. They are like my sons. So, when I come to the city and they want to meet me, I can’t say no. If the Election Commission asks me about it, I will answer.” While Dhankhar’s visits and meetings were public and he even penned a poem on the “pain” of being dragged into a controversy, Kataria arrived quietly in the city and avoided the public glare till the news of his arrival became public after local media got wind of his visit to Tank’s house. Kataria did not make any statement at the time. Emphasising this, Vallabh said, “Every post has some dignity attached to it. If a Governor of another state begins touring the city secretly in the night, questions will be asked. It does not affect me … but if you want to come, first resign.” BJP sources said Kataria stayed in the city for a good seven days and departed only last Friday. They said the Governor’s presence in the city might be the subject of the Congress’s attacks but added that it was essential to ensuring that the party wins Udaipur City without any hiccups. Kataria has won the Assembly constituency seven times since 1977, with a winning streak going back to 2003. He was appointed Assam Governor in February. “He operated out of his residence, and held a series of meetings with local party workers and leaders,” said a senior city BJP leader. “All councillors were also called. He is the tallest leader of the party in the region and commands high respect among party workers. They have been demoralised since his departure. While this is a BJP bastion, being complacent can be dangerous. He has ensured that cadres are re-energised and do not lose sight of the effort they are required to put in.” BJP insiders also pointed out that the leadership had fielded old party hand Tarachand Jain from Udaipur City. Jain has held significant party posts in Udaipur district in the past and is an experienced campaigner, but is chiefly known as Kataria’s detractor. “Before Kataria was made Governor, Jain was trying to create his own space in the city. This led to some friction. So, those who have worked for decades under the leadership of Kataria find it difficult to align with Jain,” said a leader close to the Governor. Those who have traditionally voted for the BJP also bring this up. “Jain’s candidature was a bit of a surprise because he was perceived to be anti-Kataria. But later it was said it was with Kataria’s blessing that he was made a candidate. We don’t know what happened,” said Lakshit Sharma, a BJP voter in the city, underlining that he would continue to support the party. Some BJP sources, however, said whatever differences existed between the two leaders were recently buried in the party’s interests. Jain, in his media statements, defended Kataria saying it was the Governor’s city and he could visit any time. “There are traditional BJP votes which will come to the party. But Kataria ji could swing fence-sitters too. That is where we have to work harder this time,” said a BJP leader.',\n",
              "       'Denied a ticket by BJP, Vasundhara Raje’s former No. 2 fights back in no man’s landHuddled around a photo of B R Ambedkar in Daulatpura, a large crowd mostly comprising people from the Meghwal community has been waiting patiently for several hours. Finally, the music announces the arrival of the man of the hour. Yunus Khan enters the village amid much fanfare even as people line up to greet him while a few others dance beside the tractor, which has been modified into Khan’s election vehicle. A flag bearing Khan’s election symbol – an almirah – is hoisted over it. Chants of “Yunus Khan zindabad” and “Hamara neta kaisa ho, Yunus Khan jaisa ho(How should our leader be, he should be like Yunus Khan)” reverberate as a smiling Khan— a two-time former MLA from Deedwana and once considered the second most powerful person in ex-Chief MinisterVasundhara Raje’s government — greets the crowd and makes his way into the village, where the crowd rises to greet him. Khan proceeds to garland the photograph of Ambedkar before taking a seat. The crowd, comprising people from neighbouring villages too, is asked to address the gathering. First to speak is Prabhuram from the Bairwa community, who has come to Daulatpura from neighbouring Bagatpura village. “A meeting was convened by the Bairwa samaj at Bagatpura, where a decision to vote for Khan-ji was taken. He is our vikas purush,” he says as the crowd breaks into applause. “I was an MLA from this constituency for 10 years. The people gathered here are those who stood by me in my joy and grief. The list of atrocities committed against your communities over the past five years is long. The Palot case, especially, has shamed us all,” Khan starts his address. Khan’s anti-Congresselectionpitch resembles that of theBJP, but the upcoming election is different for Khan, who is contesting as an Independent after being denied a ticket by the BJP. Deedwana has an electorate of 2.66 lakh, of which Meghwals, Bairwas and other Scheduled Castes (SCs) make up 35,000 votes. The Palot case dates back to February 2022, when a 35-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped and tortured. The woman was found six days later, with insect bites on her body, and later succumbed to her injuries. Following her death, the woman’s family and the Opposition BJP accused a local Congress worker and a member of the Deedwana Panchayat Samiti of the crime and alleged that the administration was shielding him. Both the Congress worker and the incumbent Congress MLA, Chetan Dudi, hail from the numerically dominant Jat community, which has around 60,000 votes in the constituency. Training guns on Dudi, Khan says the role played by the legislator in the Palot case was despicable. “You are an elected representative and took the side of injustice. There can be no bigger sin than this,” he says. Khan had defeated Dudi’s father Rupa Ram in the 2003 Assembly elections while in 2013, he defeated Dudi. In 1998 and 2008, Rupa Ram had successfully contested the Deedwana elections against Khan. In 2018, the BJP fielded Khan from the Tonk seat, where he lost the polls to then Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot by a margin of over 50,000 votes. Following the denial of a ticket by the BJP, the former Deedwana MLA, who was introduced to politics by former Rajasthan CM and Vice-President Bhairaon Singh Shekhawat, finds himself in a tricky situation. As the former MLA looks to plant his feet again in his bastion, the 59-year-old has thus far refrained from launching scathing attacks on his former party and has targeted Dudi more frequently during his campaign. Khan’s 25-year-long political career, during which he has served as minister of transport and Public Works Development (PWD), has been entirely built on an anti-Congress narrative. The tribute to Ambedkar shows his strategy is to to restructure the social voting pattern in Deedwana and bring together the Muslim and Dalit votes to counter Dudi’s Jat vote bank. In his bid to get cross-community support, Khan has also been visiting temples, including those of folk deities of the Jat community, and meeting people across community lines. Muslims in Deedwana have voted for the BJP, contrary to their traditional pattern of voting for the Congress, when Khan was the BJP candidate. His supporters, this time round, are hoping that sympathy for Khan might cause them to rally behind him. The former MLA’s Kayamkhani Muslim community is 50,000-strong in Deedwana. The community also has a significant population in other parts of the state, especially Nagaur and some districts of the Shekhawati region. As his campaign enters Beri Choti, a Kayamkhani Muslim majority village, Khan speaks of the community’s valour and its contribution to the Army. “This is a village where Bharat’s sanskar and sanskriti flourish. The programme here did not start with the ayat of the Quran but with a tribute to Veer Tejaji. Hum Bharat mein rehte hai (We live in Bharat),” Khan said, drawing applause from the crowd. Veer Tejaji is a local folk deity. Here, in a rare display of discontent for his former party, Khan opens up on being denied a BJP ticket. “Aaj aap musalman ka naam le kar ke jo mere saath vyavhaar kar rahe ho, ye theek nahin hai (Today how you are treating me for being a Muslim, it is not right.) I have never allowed my caste, religion and my family to interfere. I always regarded the BJP as my family and stood by it whenever required. I have always thought of Deedwana to be my family,” Khan, flanked by supporters of different communities, says. A visibly emotional Khan then proceeds to tell the crowd about the sacrifices he has made for the BJP. “Which leader would give up a safe seat like Deedwana and contest from far away Tonk against Sachin Pilot. I, as a dedicated party worker of the BJP, did it to ensure no one could point a finger at me,” he says as the crowd chants his name and moves forward to greet him. Dudi, for his part, claims that Khan’s only goal is to cut anti-BJP votes by contesting as a rebel. “The BJP has denied him a ticket but he targets the Congress everywhere. It seems like he is working for the BJP. Why should we worry? Technically, he should cut into the BJP’s votes as he is a BJP rebel. But he has been fielded by the BJP so that he cuts into the votes of Congress. People have understood the BJP’s strategy of cutting votes by fielding him. Our fight is with the BJP. Khan stands nowhere,” the MLA says. The BJP has fielded Khan’s protege Jitendra Singh Jodha, a Rajput. He was also the party’s candidate from Deedwana in 2018, when he lost to Dudi by around 40,000 votes. “When he was in the BJP, he was our leader and our workers with him. Now, he is not in the party, but we will win in Deedwana. Our fight is against the Congress,” Jodha says. Oscillating between his anti-Congress rhetoric and asking the public to vote for him and not for the BJP, Khan finds himself in a no man’s land. His dilemma is aptly showcased in a video that has been doing the rounds on social media. “On the morning of (November) 25, after praying to your ishtadev (deity) and kamal (lotus)… ,” he is seen saying in the video before abruptly stopping and realising that the BJP’s election symbol – lotus – is no longer his.',\n",

But its reverberations might be much wider. The OBC and Vimukt Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJNT) rally was perhaps the first such move to bring together all 374OBC communities under one umbrella, where leaders across parties, including those from the rulingBJP, demanded a caste census across the country. The BJP government at the Centre has hedged its bets on calls for a caste census as the Opposition has made it a poll issue. With the Marathas too showing no sign of relenting on their demand for reservation, especially due to theirnew torchbearer Manoj Jarange-Patil,the rally could rattle the tenuous truce achieved by theEknath Shinde-Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government on the matter. Other speakers at the rally, besides Bhujbal, were also strident. “The one who speaks in the interest of OBCs will rule the country,” said Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Vijay Wadettiwar. Former minister and Rashtriya Samaj Party (RSP) leader Mahadev Jankar called for all OBCs to come together and float a party of their own, instead of depending on leaders of other parties. The next plan of several OBC organisations is to hold a rally in every district of the state. With Jarange-Patil insisting that his deadline for the government to implement reservation for Marathas is non-negotiable, the meetings are likely to stir up OBCs fear that bringing Marathas into the OBC category will reduce their share of reservation. The OBC leaders have been demanding that any such quota should be separate from OBC share. The rally would also have been worrying for the BJP, which is seen to enjoy the support of the OBCs in various pockets of the state. The community is not happy with the assurance given by its state government to provide Kunbi, and hence OBC, certificates to the Marathas as a way out. Earlier, the party had undertaken an OBCyatrain the Vidarbha region of the state as a damage control exercise. The Congress too has been trying to keep the OBCs in good stead as its state chief, Nana Patole, and Wadettiwar both hail from OBC communities. For Bhujbal, it is a win-win, as he was lauded by all OBC leaders for taking the lead against the Maratha protesters. The minister urging OBCs to reply in the same vein in case Marathas resort to violence is likely to have a long-lasting impact on state politics. It has also brought to the fore the divide between the communities. Bhujbal, who had receded into the background for a while after his arrest, appears to be trying to emerge as the tallest OBC leader in the state. He is also trying to forge a new social equation with his claims that he has the support of Dalits, Muslims and tribals. The minister’s attack on his own government has seen some demands for his expulsion from the Cabinet.Shiv Sena(UBT) leader and leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Ambadas Danve condemned Bhujbal’s language and questioned how he was still a part of the Cabinet. The government’s hands though are tied as any hasty move on Maratha quota could run into a court wall. In 2021, the Supreme Court had struck down reservation granted to Marathas by the earlier BJP-Shiv Sena government, deeming it unconstitutional as it breached the 50% ceiling for reservation. The Maratha agitation has gained fresh push since Jarange-Patil resumed his indefinite hunger strike, rejecting the government’s proposal of giving Kunbi certificates to Marathas of Marathwada region only. The state government subsequently agreed to provide Kunbi certificates to all Marathas across the state, which in turn drew an OBC counter-response.',\n",

While sharing her experience as part of a task at the house, Vichitra narrated a life-changing event that forced her to leave her decade-long career and the public eye. It was a sexual harassment incident on the sets of a Telugu film in Malampuzha, Kerala is the reason for her quitting films. Without revealing the name of the film and the perpetrators, Vichitra shared how she was harassed throughout her stay in the state for the shoot. Vicihitra said, “Based on the request from a now-deceased actor, I went to act in a film Malampuzha. That’s where I met my now husband too. So, he was working in the hotel I was staying. I had a very big issue there… you know there are issues around casting. I faced that the most in that film. The reason I disappeared after 2000 is because of that incident. It became a huge incident back then and was reported in papers. It became a scar that won’t heal. Bigg Boss, on that day, was telling we should face our demons. If I speak about this, maybe, I will win over my demon.” When Vichitra arrived at the hotel, the management threw a party as they got ‘Three Star’ status. Vichitra was invited by the manager (her husband now) to attend the event. “I am meeting the hero of the film there for the first time. He looked at me and the first thing he asked me was, ‘Are you acting in the film?’. When I said ‘yes’, he replied, ‘Come to my room.’ He didn’t bother asking my name or who I am. I was shocked. I didn’t know what kind of gesture is that. That night, I went to my room and slept.” Trouble ensued for Vichitra from the next day. “The shot wouldn’t happen on time. There were a lot of problems on the sets. After six, everyone got drunk and started knocking on my doors. I still remember the banging of the doors. I told the reception not to connect any calls and leave me alone. I wanted to do my work and leave. But that didn’t happen. The issues kept cropping up.” That’s when the hotel manager stepped in and helped Vichitra. “He was not even a friend then, but he knew what was happening and asked me how he can be of help. I told him I want to change the room and no one should know where I am. So throughout the schedule he managed to shift me to different rooms. I would be in the room opposite to my previous room and I would still hear the banging there. It was not just one person. There would be multiple people. I felt bad about myself.” However, things got worse as the perpetrators got irritated and wanted to teach her a lesson. On the next day, during the shoot which involved a riot scene in a village, Vichitra was touched inappropriately. When it happened for the third time, she got hold of the guy and dragged him to the stunt master to complain. “The stunt master removed my hand and gave me a tight slap. I was stunned. I looked around if someone came out to my help. No one did. I walked out of the set. I was filled with fear, anger, and embarrassment.” Vichitra contacted the actor’s union inChennai. She was asked to return from the sets and write a complaint. However, despite her efforts, nothing happened to the abusers. “No one came to help me. It need not go to the extent of rape… even manhandling and slapping someone are crimes. I was then asked to go to police and not the Sangam.” Vichitra broke down and said, “Nothing happened. I didn’t know if I can continue to act. I was worried if my family can survive. Why this cine field? Not even one guy turned up to help me. Maybe, everyone thought I deserved it because it is a normal thing in my life. I don’t know. The president of the Sangam told me to forget all that and go back to work. I can’t forget that till date. Then my husband (the hotel manager) was helping me with the investigation. He asked me one thing, ‘Is this what you are working for? If you don’t have dignity at a place, why be there?’ It felt like a slap. I thought film industry was my family. I realised it wasn’t. I wanted to find my family. That’s when I quit the film. Then I went into a shell. My husband wanted to marry me. He has given me a dignified life and three sons.” Vichitra concluded by saying that any crime needs to be addressed immediately because it is being asked of women. Earlier, Vichitra asked her fellow contestant Akshaya to report such issues without delay, which became a topic of discussion.',\n",

              "       'Anurag Kashyap had medical emergency after being gifted bag of marijuana by fan, says misconception of him being a ‘ganjedi’ hard to shake offDirectorAnurag Kashyapsaid that the one misconception about himself that he’d want to change is that he enjoys partaking in marijuana. In an interview recently, the filmmaker said that he is actually allergic to the substance, and recalled a story about having to take an emergency antihistamine when a fan gifted him a box full of joints at a film festival. Appearing on the Flip the Script with Shubra podcast, Anurag said, “Because I’ve made Gangs of Wasseypur and Raman Raghav, people think I’m a psychopath. People are initially very scared of meeting me. And when they meet me, they get totally overwhelmed because I’m completely opposite of their perception. I can’t change that. A lot of people think that I smoke up. Often, when I get trolled, people call me ‘ganjedi’ and ‘nashedi’. But I just roll my cigarettes; they don’t even know I’m allergic to it. I get serious asthma attacks even if I smell somebody smoking pot around me.” And this is what happened at the Toronto International Film Festival once, when a fan approached Anurag with a special gift. Recalling the story, the director said, “I was in Toronto for the festival, and somebody came and said, ‘I’ve got a nice gift for you’. He had a wrapped bag, with flowers on it. And because I’m allergic to it, I can smell it from a distance. I said, ‘What’s in that bag’. He said, ‘Something you’d love’. I opened the bag, and he had rolled joints in it.”\\xa0Anurag told the man to take the marijuana away immediately. “I said, ‘What’s wrong with you? Take it away from me, take the smell away’. I had to take an antihistamine immediately. It’s that bad for me. But it’s perception. I can’t change that,” he said. Anurag has recently opened up about the many health issues he experienced during the pandemic. The filmmaker said that heslipped into a depressionfollowing professional setbacks, and then had two heart attacks. This put him on steroids, which had an impact on his weight. He said that he is taking care to get back to his best, one day at a time. Click for more updates and latestBollywood newsalong withEntertainment updates.

              "       'Sam Bahadur song Banda: ‘Unstoppable’ Vicky Kaushal is all action and no talk in latest number. WatchA week after the release of the first song, titled “Badhte Chalo“, the makers ofMeghna Gulzar’s Vicky Kaushal-starrer Sam Bahadurhave unveiled another powerful track, “Banda”, which is like an ode to the “unstoppable” Field marshal Sam Manekshaw. The 126-second music video opens with scenes of Manekshaw (Vicky Kaushal) undergoing rigorous training in his early days. As the song unfolds, glimpses from various phases of his life are depicted, showcasing his charisma and unwavering determination. The lyrics, meanwhile, highlight his silent yet resolute approach: “[He] doesn’t listen, nor does he talk; he simply continues to do [what needs to be done].” The video also offers a sneak peek into Manekshaw’s personal life, featuring moments with his wife Silloo Manekshaw (Sanya Malhotra), and a conversation between “India’s greatest soldier” and the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (Fatima Sana Shaikh). Composed by Shankar Ehsaan Loy trio, Banda has been penned by Gulzar and sung by Shankar Mahadevan. Written by Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Shrivastava and Meghna Gulzar, the film is bankrolled by Ronnie Screwvala under the banner of RSVP Movies. Sam Bahadur’s trailer, which the makers released a fortnight ago, had shown Sam Manekshaw’s exceptional leadership and the formidable challenges he faced. The first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal, Manekshaw played a pivotal role in India’s victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, leading to the creation of Bangladesh. The film also stars Neeraj Kabi, Edward Sonnenblick, Govind Namdev and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in key roles.

              "       'Content creators participating in reality shows: A fad or means to discover talent?After ruling over the internet, social media influencers and content creators have now taken the reality show space. They have been brought on board as contestants on several talent-based shows. The latest season of Indian Idol has the viral policemanRajat Rathoreas a contestant, while MasterChef India has many influencers onboard. Even dance-based shows like Dance Plus, Dance Deewane and even India’s Best Dancer have seen several social media stars competing. But is it a fair practice? Do they have an upper hand in the competition? How do show creators pick these contestants? And does their presence give the show a boost? Armed with these contestants, we decided to reach out to industry experts to decode the trend of content creators on reality shows. Michelin Star awarded-chefVikas Khanna, who is also a judge on MasterChef India shared that the show has always been a way for home cooks to extend their craft and business. He shared that social media has become an important part of the food business and it was pertinent that they also have social media creators on board. “Also, no one is critiquing their food. When they are on this show, they get refined. That also helps them start their restaurant or food businesses. They get the attention of investors and publishing houses for their future books. I always say that MasterChef India is like a boot camp or university, and these degrees always have a benefit,” the celebrity chef toldindianexpress.com.   A post shared by Sony LIV (@sonylivindia)  Producer Ranjeet Thakur also shared that while people are noticing this because of social media, they have always hunted and picked good dancers across India through networking. “Earlier, these dancers would send us their videos or someone in the team would suggest having watched someone perform somewhere. This is not a new practice. It’s just become easier as social media has given us unlimited access to talent across the country.” For these creators, being on a national platform immediately gives them an instant boost. Talking about the same, Harish Closepet, better known by his Instagram page ‘Harry’s Lunchbox’, shared with us that there are ‘pluses and minuses’ for him on the show. “For me, I am not camera shy and can give content, which helps in reality shows. However, personally, since I make lunchboxes, it’s tough for me to unlearn and start plating as per the show’s requirements. I must also add that even though I have cooked for many years, my page is relatively new. So I was taken on the show for my talent rather than my social media content.” Audition process Rukhsaar Sayeed, one of the top contestants on MasterChef India, shared how she received a call from the team for an audition. She shared that they had seen her page and even followed her entrepreneur journey, and invited her to be on the show. Initially reluctant, she decided to give it a try and now feels she made the right choice. Chef Vikas Khanna had also pickedNayanjyoti Saikialast year for the show after seeing his Instagram page. Nayanjyoti went on to win MasterChef India. “Honestly, I do not have many followers and am not too active on social media. However, because I have done my PhD in food technology, the team may have felt that I should be on the show. After my research, rather than taking up a job, I decided to start my own business and give employment to women in the valley, and make them financially independent. I feel that a platform like this is very important as one gets to put across their talent and even beliefs out there,” she shared.   A post shared by Sony LIV (@sonylivindia)  Khanna said that while a few contestants may get invited for the audition, they do need to cross the gruelling ‘test of taste’ before they are finalised. “Just like everyone else, they too give an audition. They only have a slight upper hand as they are more comfortable with cameras and also understand presentation. But that’s their doing, not ours,” he smiled to share. Connect with the audience Vikas Khanna said that reality shows are always about these contestants, and as they grow stronger in competition, they also find a connection with the audience. He shared that given they already have a fan following on social media, it helps the show as more people stand up for them, cheer for them, and also tune in because of them. Thakur, on the other hand, shared that while their being on the show helps them get a platform, the show hardly benefits from it. He mentioned that content creators’ fandom is majorly virtual and they do not care to watch a TV show, even if it’s about their favourite star. He reasoned how Bigg Boss may get YouTubers and social media stars but the show is usually won by a TV face. “We need to understand that they are on this show only for their talent and popularity. There can be more famous people but if they are not talented, they will not survive. Look at these social media stars, do people go and buy their film tickets? There is a clear demarcation there.”   A post shared by Ranjeet Thakur (@tranjeet)  The Future Ranjeet Thakur mentioned how virality would always be a phase and cannot become a sustainable career. He said that while a video of a dancer or singer may get them many followers and instant fame, it doesn’t guarantee work. Referring to the ‘Just looking like a wow’ trend, the producer said that today anything and everything can blow up but a new viral trend would be lurking close. “Everyone is using this woman’s ‘so beautiful’ line but are they buying salwar suits from her? No. Her going viral will not have any positive effect on her business. Yes, she would get short-term fame but what’s next? We don’t think about that,” he said. For Vikas Khanna, however, social media has become an important part of the food ecosystem. He added how the medium has opened up so much and one cannot disregard their importance. “They do help in diverting traffic or changing the direction and opinions. So one has to honour them. Today, young kids have gotten into blogging and critiquing and they do have a hand in driving the economy.” The youngest contestant on the show, Kenny G from Bengaluru, said that while many creators enter reality shows to give their talent a platform, it’s the other way round for him. All of 18, he shared that while he has been toying with the idea of creating content, now that he is a known face among food fans, it would make his journey easier. He also mentioned how his parents, who were skeptical about his career choice, have finally given him the go-ahead. “They always felt it was a hobby but now they want me to start creating content and take cooking seriously.”',\n",

              "       'Anurag Kashyap reveals he broke down every room in his house to keep family and ‘riff-raff’ out: ‘I’ve isolated myself’Director Anurag Kashyap said that he was ‘heartbroken’ when Phantom Films, the production company he co-ran with filmmakers Vikramaditya Motwane, Vikas Bahl and Madhu Mantena, closed down following the #MeToo allegations against Bahl. But he bottled up his emotions and doubled down on work, whichaffected his health adversely. In a new interview, Anurag said that he has taken steps to take back control of his life, which includes shutting out people and isolating himself. For the longest time, he said on Flip the Script with Shubra podcast, he would welcome strugglers into his house and offer his mentorship to anybody in need of it. But how can you give water to somebody with an empty glass, he reasoned in the interview, explaining why he made the decision to focus on himself, and what that implies. “My house had a lot of rooms, and every time somebody was passing through, they’d stay there. I broke all the rooms. There’s only one room.” He continued, “This time, consciously, I’ve the kitchen also out. I need my isolation. I’ve isolated myself. I’m with my books and my movies and my shows. Even if family comes, I say, ‘I don’t have space in my house’.” Anurag said that drawing these boundaries has fuelled his creativity, and that he hasn’t written this much in over half a decade. He said, “When my company broke down, I was heartbroken. But instead of dealing with that pain, I rushed into work. I made film after film, series after series. Emotionally, I was all over the place, but I didn’t accept it. Suddenly, the lockdown happened, and there was nothing I could escape to. And I had to face myself, and I imploded.” Anurag said that he has always been a hyper-sensitive person, but had to learn to take a step back in order to fix his own problems first. Asked how he keeps the ‘yes men’ and the ‘riff-raff’ out of his orbit now, he said, “Earlier, I was surrounded by a lot of people. The idea was to encourage them. And now, it’s tiring for me. People still come to me thinking I will do something for them. But I say no, I’m not the charitarian.”',\n",
              "       'Ranbir Kapoor says his character in Animal as ‘tough and uncompromising’ as Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy, but more ‘relatable, human’Ranbir Kapoor’s character in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s upcoming film, Animal has been drawing attention ever since thefilm’s teaserandsongswere released. In a recent interview, Ranbir has shared how his character in the film is similar yet different from Arjun Reddy andKabir Singh, the infamous protagonists of Vanga. He also shared that Animal is a film which will keep the audience at the edge of their seats. While speaking to Variety, Ranbir clarified that the reason he chose to do Animal was not the success of Vanga’s previous films,Arjun Reddyand Kabir Singh. Instead, it was the script of the film. However, he did enjoy watching Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh. Ranbir said, “I was really drawn to the script of Animal. It’s a unique and intense story that immediately caught my attention. As for watching Arjun Reddy or Kabir Singh, I must admit that I did watch both films and found them to be incredibly powerful and impactful. However, my decision to accept Animal was not solely based on those films.” The actor looked at the opportunity to do Animal as a chance to “explore new dimensions’ in his acting journey and a way to break out of his on-screen image of a lover boy. Calling his character “multi-dimensional and complex”, Ranbir accepted that his character in Animal has traits of Vanga’s leading men. He shared, “My character in Animal does possess some of the traits typically associated with Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s protagonists. He is indeed tough and uncompromising in certain aspects.” But there are some traits which also set him apart. Ranbir added, “While he may exhibit strength and determination, there are also moments of vulnerability and internal conflict that make him more relatable and human.” In the movie, Ranbir plays a doting son to his father, played by Anil Kapoor. He is also shown to be madly in love with Rashmika Mandanna’s character. Bobby Deol will be seen as an antagonist in the drama. Ranbir is confident that the narrative and characters of Animal will keep the viewers ‘captivated’. He described the film as, “Animal is a gripping and intense film that delves into the depths of human emotions and relationships. It explores the complexities of life and the choices we make, with a narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Animla will hit the screens on December 1, along with Meghna Gulzar’s Sam Bahadur, starring Vicky Kaushal in the titular role.',\n",

The song, which has already accumulated over 103 million views on YouTube, features bothSalman KhanandKatrina Kaifbringing their A-game. Meanwhile, choreographer Vaibhavi Merchant, who composed the steps for “Leke Prabhu Ka Naam“, recently shared insights into her experience working with the two actors and opened up about whether it was a challenge to make Salman Khan dance. “It is a challenge for anyone to make him dance if you give him steps out of his comfort zone in terms of his body language, body structure and his physicality,” she said during a chat withDNA. “You must understand the psyche of the actor and if he is comfortable doing those steps. You need to bring in something that will excite both, Salman and his audiences. Our cinema is about envisioning our superstars to come and do something which is beyond larger than life, and that’s what I always attempt to achieve,” Vaibhavi added. The National Award-winning choreographer also hailed Katrina Kaif and said, “I have known Katrina even before she joined films. She had briefly come in through someone to train. She has made an immense growth since then and with the amount of hard work she puts in, she has always been at the forefront through her dancing skills.” Referring to thecontroversy surrounding the “Besharam Rang”track in Siddharth Anand’s Shah Rukh Khan,Deepika Padukone-starrerPathaan, she said: “Whatever happened with Besharam Rang, eventually in hindsight, it did what it needed to do, which is it generated not just a conversation but created a havoc.” “The good part is that the people who believed in it were answering on all our behalf, people realised that it was completely baseless and unnecessary. I was amused by the radicality of it because there are far more things happening in the world which need immediate attention and an actress’ costume colour was the least of it,” she observed.',\n",

At the IFFI Masterclass, Sunny sat down for a discussion with directors Anil Sharma, Rajkumar Santoshi and Rahul Rawail. The directors revealed howSunnyalways listened to them, despite sometimes being the producer of the film. Rahul also recalled how Sunny, who was the hero in a film, stepped in when the duplicate failed to do a scene. Santoshi, who helmed Ghayal, was explaining a scene in the film and said that Sunny had to save the heroine from goons in the particular scene. He said, “Sunny usually does not smoke cigarettes, but in that film, he does it with style. Then he turns back and hits the goons, both fall on each side and the fight scene is over. Sunny then sees there is blood on his hands and he wipes it on the boss’s shirt (in the film) and leaves.” After looking at the scene, stunt director Tinnu Anand told Santoshi, “Tinnu said, ‘No, we want a fight with Sunny.’ I went and told Sunny, ‘this is what I want and Tinnu is saying this.’ Sunny said, ‘Raj is right. Fight is not required here.’ Sunny never interfered with the director. Even though he could have done it.” Rahul also took a trip down the memory lane and said, “Sunny does not say no to anything. While filming Betaab, Sunny had to tame a wild horse. We thought ‘Sunny cannot do this.’ So Tinu Varma was the duplicate. But Tinu Varma started screaming while filming the shot. So finally, Sunny did the duplicate shots as well. So I said that this has happened for the first time that a hero became the duplicate’s duplicate.” Sunny was recently seen in the blockbuster film Gadar 2, marking his solid return to the box office.

              "       'Netflix abandoned Vikramaditya Motwane’s Indira Gandhi documentary, Anurag Kashyap’s magnum opus after Tandav controversyWhen Warner Bros announced that it wasn’t going to release the completed Batgirl film and was instead going cut losses with a tax write-off, the move was described as unprecedented. The studio had already spent nearly $100 million on the superhero movie. WB did the same thing again recently with the Coyote vs Acme film, and this time, the industry didn’t stay quiet. Faced with growing pressure, the studio allowed the filmmakers to shop Coyote vs Acme around to other interested distributors, instead of letting it sit on a shelf. But decision-making like this has been common in the Indian streaming industry, the Washington Post recently reported. Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Prime Video ask for extensive changes to be made to stories involving politics, caste, and religion, when they aren’t ‘politely passing’ on the projects altogether. “Why greenlight it, then change your mind?” asked Anurag Kashyap, whose magnum opus three-part adaptation of Suketu Mehta’s Maximum City was abandoned by Netflix, sending him into a depressive spiral. The same streamer alsocancelled all plans to release director Dibakar Banerjee’s completed film Tees, reportedly about a Kashmiri family’s struggles in current day India. Banerjee shot the film in 2020 and delivered it to Netflix last year. After months of non-committal communication, the streamer informed him that it would not be moving forward with the release. “Netflix has never given me any other reason except they don’t know if this is the right time to release the film,” Banerjee told Deadline, adding that he was barred from screening the film at festivals, but has been allowed to show it to potential new buyers. Also axed by Netflix is director Vikramaditya Motwane’s documentary Indi(r)a’s Emergency, which recently screened at the Jio MAMIMumbaiFilm Festival and the Dharamshala International Film Festival. The Washington Post reported that the streamer invested over $1 million into the project, before getting cold feet about the parallels that it draws to the current regime’s tactics. Netflix has since relinquished the rights to the film. Coincidentally, each of these three filmmakers was instrumental in launching the streamer in India. Motwane and Kashyap worked together on Sacred Games; Kashyap also worked on the anthology films Lust Stories and Ghost Stories with Banerjee. Netflix responded with this statement: “We have an incredibly broad range of Indian original films and TV shows, all of which speak to our long standing support for creative expression. This diversity not only reflects our members’ very different tastes, it also distinguishes our service from the competition.” One of the first completed shows to be cancelled before release was the political satire Gormint, which was once set to star the lateIrrfanKhan, who was replaced by Manav Kaul. The nine-episode series was shut down following the Tandav controversy, which is seen as a pivotal moment for not just Indian streaming, but the Indian film industry as a whole. A section of the right-wing took offence to certain scenes in the Prime Video show, which resulted in numerous police complaints. The scenes were eventually removed from the show, and apologies widely disseminated. “At Prime Video we take our responsibilities seriously and make our programming decisions thoughtfully,” the Post quoted Prime Video as saying in response. “It is creative evolution in reverse,” Gormint direct Ayappa KM told the Washington Post. “Only passive, thoroughly sanitised content stands a chance on most platforms now.” “OTT ki aaj ki date mein himmat nahi hai, Tandav ke baad sab dar gaye hain(OTT has lost its spine, everybody is scared after Tandav),”Anurag Kashyap told Mashable recently. “You wanted to make sure that you are not making the same mistakes that happened on Tandav,” a former Netflix employee told the Post.',\n",

              "       'Want to delve into Korean cuisine? Here are 5 types of kimchi you can tryAchaar. A food group Indians can hardly do without. And who thought we would have this in common with Koreans?The Korean kimchiis, in its basest form, anachaar,with all the makings of one. Made with salted and fermented vegetables, kimchi is perhaps the staple of Korean cuisine. I once heard an actor in a K-drama say that kimchi might be able to exist without Korea but Koreans could never be separated from their kimchi. Though it is essentially made with vegetables, authentic kimchi often includes fish sauce in its recipe so if you’re a vegetarian, make sure to check the ingredients before you eat it. Chef Hanumanta Deora, head chef, Barn@Food Square, presents us with 5 types of kimchi you can try. “Each variation introduces an enticing deviation fromthe cherished Korean classic,” he tellsindianexpress.comin an interaction. Whether you prefer the classic spiciness or want to opt for a milder, refreshing experience, these five types of kimchi will deliver. A staple in Korean cuisine, this kimchi variety features Napa cabbage fermented with a harmonious blend of Korean red pepper flakes, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. It embodies the quintessential spicy and umami-rich profile that has made kimchi renowned worldwide. Characterised by its light and watery base, Water kimchi is a delightful departure from the usual spice. Featuring Korean radish, carrots, cucumber, green onions, ginger, and garlic, all submerged in a brine, this variation delivers a crisp and refreshing taste. For those seeking a departure from the cabbage-centric varieties, pakimchitakes green onions to the forefront. Coated in a paste of Korean red pepper flakes, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic, this kimchi offers a bold and savory alternative. Diverging from the traditional red hue, white kimchi excludes the red pepper flakes. Instead, it embraces a milder yet equally flavorful combination of julienned Korean pear, radish, pine nuts, salt, sugar, ginger, and garlic, offering a refreshing departure from the norm. Oi Sobagi presents a unique twist with small cucumbers stuffed with a flavourful mixture of Korean radish, red pepper flakes, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. The result is a delightful marriage of crunch and spice in every bite. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'How storytelling for children has evolvedToday, there is a fantastic range of children’sbooks, for ages 0 to teens, with parents taking out time to find the right ones for their kids. More than that, sharing and discussing the books has become of prime importance. “Quantity time, not quality time, is important,” feels educator, naturalist, and writer Zai Whitaker. The age-old maxim of ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ cannot be taken for granted becausechildrenquestion what happens in stories far more than they used to, pointed out author Deepa Agarwal who writes both for children and adults. “They are not passive listeners. Even folktales which used to be readily accepted as they were, require explanations and logical justifications. A storyteller needs to rewrite the script to capture the attention of her audience and make sure the narrative and characters have credibility, especially now that the electronic methods of storytelling with startling special effects are grabbing the attention of the young,” she said. Readingabout other beliefs, different cultures, and ways of life not only broadens the mind but promotes understanding and empathy. “The commonly mentioned benefits like gaining knowledge, increasing vocabulary and communication skills, improving concentration, enhancing creativity and reducing stress cannot be emphasised enough too,” said Deepa, who has written books likeFolk Tales Of Uttarakhand, andThe Teenage Diary of Nur Jahanto name a few. Parents should begin as early as possible by letting babies handle cloth or vinyl books, sing lullabies, repeat rhymes, and read aloud to them. “This develops a lifelong connection with books. The choice of reading material is also important, and parents should be sensitive to their child’sresponsesto stories. Reading aloud should continue even after a child has learned to decipher words and sentences as a way to spend quality time with a child,” Deepa said. Zai’s 18 years of teaching English, and “slyly trying out my writing on my students”, flagged three things for her: that the writing, however simple, should have exciting ‘aha’ moments; that there’s a fine balance between humour and bad taste; that not all children’s life experiences can be successfully represented in literature. As technology continues to advance, we are likely to see greater innovation and stories will be interpreted in numerous ways, providing greater choice to the audience. Despite that, reading should and must be prioritised, authors urge. “Children today engage with stories not just through print or oral storytelling but animpressivevariety of mediums. All this is very exciting, but I feel there is no substitute for the benefits reading in print provides,” said Deepa, who has covered historical fiction to fantasy, retold traditional tales to realistic fiction in her works. Zai too affirmed and shared, “I continue to say, stodgily and boringly, that there’s no substitute for a book…” Zai who wrote a little play once, shared that it was good to hear from a family that they enjoyed performing it. “Many children love to dress up and perform and there’s usually a role for even those who don’t, when a “production” is being developed. Also, as a teacher, I converted several stories such as Maupassant’sThe Necklaceinto plays, and we had a lot of fun. So, I would encourage writers to look at this genre, this possibility,” said Zai. We need more sports fiction and home-grown fantasy, Deepa feels as she stressed the need for coveringclimate change, ecology, and other issues the world is facing like children in conflict zones and displacement. “Though many excellent books have been written, theyoung adultgenre also needs more representation because exploring teenage problems in books can be a form of support at this vulnerable age. There has been an explosion in non-fiction writing but there is scope for much more,” said Deepa, whose latest bookThe Arthashastra for Children, an adaptation of Kautilya’s classic on statecraft, uses many examples from world history and contemporary situations to demonstrate his theories. “I think it is important for children to gain insights into the way governments work, or should work, outside of their textbooks. They have much greater exposure to world politics. More information books about career options, possibly through real-life stories, would also be useful,” added Deepa. These significant conversations are part of the 15th edition of Bookaroo Children’s Festival scheduled to take place November 24-25, 2023, at Sunder Nursery, Nizamuddin,Delhifrom 11 am to 4:30 pm where authors like Zai and Deepa along with many others will hold 78 sessions over two days. Talking about looking forward to the event, Deepa said Bookaroo is a major event on the calendar for both children and parents. “Meeting their favourite authors, listening to them talk about their books, and getting books signed makes it a special experience for young book lovers. Bookaroo has made an impact on children’s book publishing too because it offers a wonderful opportunity for publishers to showcase titles.” Zai, who is popular for her workSalim Mamoo and Me, addresses such events as “important spaces”, hugely enjoyed by the whole family… “and that some parents should let their kids choose books, rather than do it for them!” Children’s book publishing has come a long way. However, considering our vast population and the number of schools all over the country, book sales remain discouraging. “Children’s books by Indian authors are not marketed as actively as books for adults, because they contribute greatly in building a base of dedicated readers. This becomes demotivating for authors who invest so much of themselves into writing a book,” Deepa said. There is also the unfortunate assumption that writing a book for children is child’s play, that it is an “easier” kind of writing. “This is something that needs to change. Children’s writing must receive its due as asignificant genre,” Deepa concluded. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",

On November 23, Information Technology (IT) MinisterAshwini Vaishnawwill chair a meeting with them, and a day later, on November 24, Minister of State for IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar will discuss the issue with the platforms. During the meetings, the government is expected to share a standard operating procedure with the companies on how they should deal with deepfakes on their platforms. Executives from Meta andGoogleare expected to attend. Last Friday, Prime MinisterNarendra Modisaid it’s important to understand how artificial intelligence (AI) works as it could be used to create deepfakes to purposefully spread false information or have malicious intent behind their use. A deepfake is a video of a person in which the face or body has been digitally altered so that he or she appears to be someone else, typically used to spread false information. Mostly, a controversy erupted after a video of actress Rashmika Mandanna entering an elevator went viral on social media. What initially appeared genuine was, in fact, a deepfake of the actress. The original video featured a British Indian person, and their face was morphed to insert Mandanna’s face instead. Not only this, there has been a surge of deepfake audios and videos of political leaders on platforms like Instagram. “In the next three-four days, we will have a meeting with all platforms. We will brainstorm on that (deepfake), and make sure that platforms make adequate efforts for preventing, avoiding, cleaning up their platforms,” Vaishnaw said on November 18. Earlier this month, the IT Ministry had also sent advisories to social media platforms, includingFacebook, Instagram and YouTube, to take down deepfakes. The advisory had reiterated existing legal provisions that platforms have to follow as online intermediaries. It has mentioned Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, which entails punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resources with imprisonment up to three years and fine up to Rs 1 lakh. The advisory also mentioned Rule 3(2)(b) of the Information Technology Rules, under which social media platforms are required to take down content in the nature of impersonation, including artificially morphed images of an individual.',\n",

Additional Secretary at the commerce ministry, Rajesh Agarwal clarified that the agreement mentioned imposing “unnecessary” export restrictions, but it is caveated and is similar to the World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions and not beyond that. If a country imposes any export curb without giving any justification, that is treated as unnecessary, he clarified. Use of export restrictions assumes significance as India has extensively used measures to ensure food security and arrest food prices in the run up to the general elections. “Under the supply chain agreement, there is nothing where in our policy space to exercise our rights of change in tariffs or change in export policy…whatever is necessary for the country’s food security or any other requirement of the country also, that policy space remains with us,” Agarwal said. According to him, India will not have to provide any kind of advance information to IPEF members about doing any change in customs duties. IPEF was launched jointly by the United States and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 last year largely to counter China’s influence on trade. The framework is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except trade. Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam are members of the bloc.',\n",

G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant, while speaking at a curtain raiser briefing for the Virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit Tuesday, said development will be the core agenda, while leaders may discuss many other issues. “Since our successful hosting of the G20 Leaders’ Summit on September 9-10 and the unanimous adoption of the NewDelhiLeaders’ Declaration, the world has actually witnessed a succession of events and several new challenges have emerged. While development will be the core agenda and we will focus on the development issue, the leaders may discuss many other issues and the virtual summit will provide an opportunity not only to discuss the implementation of the Leaders’ Declaration but also for leaders to share views and enhance cooperation on critical challenges that we confront and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm our existing commitments towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives,” he said. When asked if the Israel-Hamas conflict will be discussed, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said he “didn’t want to prejudge what issues would be raised by the leaders”. He also said that the Summit’s attendance is not expected to be any different in terms of participation seen at the New Delhi Leaders’ Summit held in September.

              "       'Govt, RBI on ‘high alert’ on inflation; rate hike transmission may temper demand: Finance MinistryEven as “inflationary pressures” have moderated, there are persistent downside risks to growth and macroeconomic stability from inflation which continues to keep the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on “high alert”, Ministry of Finance said in its latest monthly economic review for October 2023. The Ministry also said that a fuller transmission of the monetary policy, which essentially means pass-through of the central bank’s rate hikes to consumers by banks, may also temper domestic demand. “With more than half of the current financial year witnessing positive developments in the economy, the full financial year should conclude as projected with a strong growth performance and macroeconomic stability. Yet risks on the downside persist.Inflationis one of them that has kept both the government and the RBI on high alert. Financial flows in the external sector also need constant monitoring as they impact the value of rupee and the balance of payments. A fuller transmission of the monetary policy may also temper domestic demand,” the report said. Headlineretail inflationhad slipped to a four-month low of 4.87 per cent in October. However, inflation concerns continue to persist. Last week, RBI in its monthly bulletin had said that while festival demand remains “ebullient” and consumer sentiment is “upbeat”, India has “miles to go” and is “not out of the woods yet” on inflation. Also, the Ministry pointed out that transmission of the monetary policy tightening “may be beginning to take effect”, which may impact domestic demand. “Against a cumulative hike of 250 basis points (bps) in policyrepo rate, lending rates have increased by 187 bps in respect of fresh loans and 105 bps in respect of outstanding loans,” it said. At the same time, the Ministry said the festive season has “further strengthened consumption demand”. “While accumulated savings and declining rates of unemployment constitute the underlying strength of consumption demand, the wealth effect emanating from rising real estate prices and growing capitalisation of equity markets may have also strengthened consumption,” it said. The Ministry also emphasised that the central government is on track to achieve the budgeted fiscal deficit target for the current financial year supported by buoyancy in revenue mop-up and prudent expenditure management. “Continued buoyancy in revenue collections supported by prudent expenditure management has enabled the fiscal deficit to be contained within 40 per cent of the Budget Estimate during the first half of the year. The government’s emphasis on capital expenditure has continued during the year as well, imparting an impetus to private investment. The recent steep and rapid decline in global crude oil prices removes an important source of potential impact on public finances as well,” it said. On the growth front, the ministry said India’s growth experience in 2023-24 should continue to be a positive outlier as compared to other major economies. “The government’s sustained investment push, healthy corporate profits, and a reduction in bank non-performing loans will likely keep investment buoyant despite elevated input costs. India’s exports are also expected to perform well, driven by strong performance in services exports,” it said.',\n",

The terms of reference for asset valuers included describing and listing of all the properties and assets, including intangibles such as trademark(s), title to property rights being valued, as provided by the bank. Valuation of intangibles were required to be indicated separately. The DIPAM had earlier said the bank has 120 properties in the top seven cities. These include 68 properties inMumbai, 20 inPune, nine inChennaiand seven inAhmedabad. Besides, it has six properties inKolkataand five each inDelhiandHyderabad. The asset properties in the seven cities account for 94 per cent of the total written down value (after accounting for depreciation) of fixed assets of IDBI Bank. The government and LIC together hold 94.72 per cent stake in IDBI Bank. Pursuant to the strategic sale transaction, the government will own 15 per cent stake and LIC 19 per cent shareholding in IDBI Bank, taking their total holding to 34 per cent.',\n",

The deadline to submit takeover bids ends on Tuesday, and the sources told Reuters Jindal had decided against bidding after evaluating the airline’s financial statements. While the deadline can be extended via an application to the courts, creditors are currently not inclined to do so, two banking sources said. “The EoI was largely to check the valuation of the airline and get access to the company’s data,” said one of the sources. “After evaluation, the company has decided not to put in a bid.” The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Jindal Power and Go First’s resolution professional did not reply to emails seeking comment. Go First filed for voluntary insolvency in May and owes a total of 65.21 billion rupees ($785.6 million) to its creditors. Bankers had pinned their hopes on Jindal’s interest, said a banker at a lender that has exposure to Go First.“But it looks like that hasn’t materialised,” the banker added, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. The Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank and Deutsche Bank are among the top creditors to the airline.The Committee of Creditors will meet on Wednesday to decide the future course of action, said another banker. He also declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Both bankers said the liquidation of the airline was now the most likely option as there were no serious bidders.Banks are already evaluating a property that is held as collateral with lenders in case of liquidation, one of the bankers said. Go First is currently locked in a legal tussle with its lessors after they were blocked from repossessing planes due to a moratorium imposed by Indian courts. A recent amendment to India’s insolvency rules allows lessors to take back the planes, but a court has yet to determine whether this change can be applied retrospectively to Go First.',\n",

              "       'SEBI chief urges investors to take long-term view of markets to beat inflation rateSEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Monday urged investors to invest on a long-term basis as it would help in wealth creation, beat inflation and provide real rate of returns. Referring to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent study, which showed that around 89 per cent of the individual traders in the equity Futures and options (F&O) segment incurred losses with an average loss of Rs 1.1 lakh during FY 2021-2022 (FY22), Buch said she was confused and surprised as to why people continue to trade in the segment knowing that the odds are not in their favour at all. “There is a 90 per cent chance that the investor will lose money in the F&O segment. But we also know and the data shows us that, if you take a long-term view of the market and if you invest with a long term perspective, you will rarely go wrong,” she said at the launch of an Investor Risk Reduction Access (IRRA) platform. F&O are derivative instruments where traders buy an underlying asset (share) at a predetermined price. SEBI’s study, released in January this year, stated that 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), on an average, loss makers registered net trading loss close to Rs 50,000 in FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), the average loss of a loss maker was over 15 times the average profit by a profit maker during FY22, the study showed. Buch said the real power lies in the hands of the investors if they take a longer-term view on their investments. If investors take a long-term view, there is really a good chance that they would be creating wealth for themselves and their family over a sustained period of time that would “exceed theinflationrate in the economy”, and therefore, they would actually get “real rate of return on their investments over the long-term”, she said. At the end of September 2023, 3.35 crore demat accounts were registered with National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and 9.62 crore with Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL), as per the SEBI’s October bulletin. IRRA platform, which was launched by Buch, is conceptualised and implemented by market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) under the guidance of SEBI to reduce risks faced by investors in the eventuality of technical glitch at trading member end at both primary site and disaster recovery site. It provides investors an opportunity to square off or cancel their pending orders in case of a disruption of trading services provided by trading members. Buch said the IRRA platform is a safety net that will help people to invest with confidence.“The hope is that this is a system that we will never need to use. It’s like a safety net which is there for a trapeze artist…he hopes to never use that safety net but it really needs to be there,” she said. IRRA can be invoked by trading members when they are faced with a technical glitch at their end impacting their ability to service clients across exchanges from both – primary site and disaster recovery site, where relevant. On invocation, after basic checks, the platform downloads trades of trading members from all the trading venues and sends SMS/email to investors using internet trading or wireless technology along with a link to access IRRA. Investors using this link can review the status of their investment, orders etc, and place orders for squaring off or closing positions. Speaking on the upstreaming of clients funds by stock brokers (SBs)/ clearing members (CMs) to clearing corporations (CCs), the chairperson said though it was implemented, the regulator has received feedback about difficulty in complying with the guidelines. As per the framework, SBs/CMs cannot retain clients’ funds on an end of day (EoD) basis. The clients’ funds has to be upstreamed by SB/ CMs to CCs only in the form of either cash, lien on fixed deposit receipts (FDR), or pledge of units of Mutual Fund Overnight Schemes (MFOS). Buch said the regulator, after taking feedback from brokers, will be soon issuing a new notification on the upstreaming of funds. “The operational challenges that were faced by our brokers in terms of the upstreaming circular are now pretty much resolved, and hopefully we should have a notification which now simplifies everybody’s life quite considerably,” she said.',\n",
              "       'Religare board rallies around Rashmi Saluja, defends her share salesThe board of directors of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL), which is engaged in a battle for control with the Burmans of the Dabur group, has come out in support of its Executive Chairperson Rashmi Saluja, stating she had turned around the financial services company. “The accusations are not only against Rashmi in isolation but targeted toward the entire management and the board that has worked tirelessly and with dedication and commitment to make Religare a debt free organization over five years,” REL board said in a statement, defending the share sale and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOPs) of Saluja. There are five non-executive independent directors on the REL board, according to the BSE. They are: Malay Kumar Sinha, Hamid Ahmed, Praveen Kumar Tripathi, Ranjan Dwivedi and Preeti Madan. The Burmans, who have made an open offer to take control of REL, have levelled a series of allegations against the REL Chairperson and the company. The board of the financial services company said “a historic revival” and “one time settlement” of RFL was completed through organic collections and payments of more than Rs 9,000 crore made to the country’s banking system. “As result of the overall growth of all businesses, the company’s market cap has remarkably increased to about a billion dollars from a low of under $100 million in March 2018,” the board said. Clarifying the current allegations, the board said, “sale of REL shares by Executive Chairperson categorically denies the fact that the representative of the Burman family informed her of the proposed open offer during the said meeting on September 20, 2023. The said sale of shares by Saluja liquidating her ESOPs was along with 12 other employees of REL.” “This process of liquidation of ESOPs through financing and sale was set in motion several days before the said meeting that happened on September 20, 2023. The actual sale of shares that happened on September 21 and 22, 2023 was made at the prevalent market price,” the statement said. The board said the Care Health Insurance ESOPs were granted to Rashmi Saluja only in her capacity as employee/Executive Director and Chairperson of REL. The ESOPs were not to be granted to her in her capacity as Non-Executive Chairperson of Care Health Insurance Limited. “The above issuance of ESOPs to EC has been in full conformity with the guidelines of the Insurance Regulator applicable to insurance companies,” it said. “The remuneration of Saluja has been performance-linked and has been approved by theNRC, the Board and the Shareholders of REL. Any change in the above needs approval from the shareholders, which has been obtained with an overwhelming majority each time as required,” it said. Saluja was reappointed as the Executive Chairperson in February 2023, for a second term, for a five-year period, through a resolution by the board and approval of shareholders. As per the Annual Report for FY 22-23 of REL, the remuneration for the Executive Chairperson was Rs 8.12 crore… even after including the perquisites value of the ESOPs, it reached a figure of Rs 42.06 crore, the statement said. REL shares rose 5.64 per cent to Rs 229.50 on the BSE on Monday.',\n",
              "       'RBI’s tightening of lending norms for unsecured loans is credit positive, says Moody’sThe Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) recent move to tighten the risk weights on unsecured personal loans and credit cards by banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) is credit positive because lenders will need to allocate higher capitals, which will improve their loss-absorbing buffers, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on Monday. Last week, the RBI increased the risk weights on the exposure of banks towards consumer credit, credit card receivables and NBFCs by 25 per cent up to 150 per cent. “The tightening of underwriting norms through higher risk-weighted assets is credit positive because lenders will need to allocate higher capitals for such loans improving their loss-absorbing buffers and may dampen their growth appetite,” Moody’s Investors Services said. Risk weight refers to the capital banks keep aside as provisioning to cover any loan defaults. As per State Bank of India’s (SBI) Group Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the banking industry will require Rs 84,000 crore of excess capital or five per cent increase on Rs 15.2 lakh crore capital requirement following the rise in risk weights on these unsecured personal loans. This means a 55-60 basis point increase in CRAR (Capital to risk weighted assets ratio) due to these regulatory measures. The report said that the unsecured segment has been growing very rapidly in the past few years exposing financial institutions to a potential spike in credit costs in case of sudden economic or interest rate shocks. In the past two years, personal loans grew around 24 per cent and credit card loans grew 28 per cent on average compared with overall banking sector’s credit growth of around 15 per cent, Moody’s Investors Service said. According to the report, banks would be able to absorb higher risk weights on their capital because the overall banking sector’s exposure to unsecured retail credit is small at around 10 per cent of loans as of September 2023 and the sector’s overall capitalisation is at historically high levels with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.9 per cent as of March 2023. However, the impact of the new underwriting rules could vary among individual lenders depending on their exposure to unsecured loans, it said.',\n",
              "       'GDP growth may decline marginally to 6.3% in 2024: Goldman SachsIndia’s real GDP growth rate is likely to moderate marginally to 6.3 per cent in 2024 from estimated 6.4 per cent growth for 2023, according to a report from Goldman Sachs. However, it is likely to be a tale of two halves, the report said. “Subsidies and transfer payments as we head into the general elections in Q2 2024 will likely be the growth driver in the first half. Post-elections, we expect investment growth to re-accelerate, especially from the private side,” Goldman Sachs said. “While we expect the government to continue its focus on capital spending, given the medium-term fiscal consolidation path, the rate of growth in capex will likely decrease from next fiscal year,” the report said. Risks around the growth outlook are evenly balanced in our view with the main domestic risk emanating from political uncertainty with elections approaching in Q2 2024. Goldman Sachs said repeated supply shocks along with stable growth are likely to keepinflationabove the central point of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target of 4.0 per cent in 2024. “We forecast headline CPI inflation to decline to 5.1 per cent year-on-year (average) in 2024, above the RBI’s and consensus forecast of 4.7 per cent year-on-year, from an estimated 5.7 per cent in 2023,” it said. “We expect the government to intervene through subsidies or other measures to keep a lid on food prices in an election year. While core goods inflation declined in line with our expectation in 2023, the decline in core services inflation took us by surprise, especially given resilient growth,” it said. Going forward, core inflation is expected to decline to 4.5 per cent year-on-year (average) in 2024 from an estimated 5.1 per cent in 2023. Somewhat elevated inflation relative to target will limit the room for monetary easing. “We forecast the RBI to cut only 50 bps to 6.00 per cent by early 2025. Our US economics team forecast the easing cycle to start in Q4 2024, and forecast a higher neutral rate for theFedat 3.50 – 3.75 per cent, above the central bank’s current estimates of long-run sustainable levels,” it said. The “higher-for-longer” global scenario and elevated inflation domestically will mean continued hawkish guidance and tight banking system liquidity from the RBI until theMonetary Policy Committee(MPC) feels confident about inflation aligning with the 4.0 per cent target, Goldman Sachs said. Higher oil prices, slower growth in trading partners, and steady domestic growth is likely to increase thecurrent account deficitby 60 bps to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2024. “While services exports have peaked (as a share of GDP) in our view, they will continue to cushion a wide goods trade deficit in 2024. Foreign portfolio inflows from India’s inclusion in a global bond index should help fund the current account deficit,” Goldman Sachs said. “Over the last two years, Indian policymakers deftly managed a difficult combination of multiple commodity (food and oil) supply shocks and high Fed funds rate,” it said. They did so through a combination of monetary tightening, using fiscal policy to absorb some supply shocks, and judicious use of forex reserves to maintain a stable currency. Macro-economic resilience in recent years aided India’s inclusion in the JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index (beginning June 2024), and could prompt passive inflows of around USD 25-30 billion over the scale-in period. “With India benefiting from regional supply chain diversification, we expect continued direct investment inflows, although capital inflows will likely remain muted globally in a high interest-rate environment. Overall, we think the current account deficit should be comfortably funded next year,” Goldman Sachs said.',\n",

              "       'Scamming the scammers: How borrowers create fake IDs to deceive fake loan appsBasic media editing and computer skills, a ‘clean’ phone, some determination and Rs 300 — that is all it takes to turn the tables and scam predatory lending apps. Using fake documents and phone data, people who have been borrowing small sums from instant loan apps have found a way to dodge the usurious interest rates and continuous mental harassment that borrowers usually face at the hands of dubious digital lenders. Over the last four months,The Indian Expressspoke with a range of stakeholders including borrowers, fintech intermediaries, government functionaries, big tech companies and former RBI officials that pointed towards how, in the absence of any government and regulatory norms, online platforms such as Meta,Google,Apple’s App Store and WhatsApp carry out little due diligence and let fraudsters openly advertise predatory loan apps. In Part 2 of this series, The Indian Express details how an entire online ecosystem has mushroomed to take on loans issued by fraudulent apps. An investigation has revealed that for a mere Rs 300, unscrupulous borrowers use ‘information packs’ – forged government-issued ID cards, text message folder, contact list and a photo gallery full of images generated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) – that are sold on messaging app Telegram. All that the borrower needs then to pull off a successful con on the app is an empty phone to load the forged documents (Aadhaarand PAN cards) and information packs (fake text message folder, contact list and photo gallery) to create a fake digital trail. The fake digital history looks convincing enough for a loan app to then issue the money — typically between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000 for a week. The harassment to repay the loan usually starts around the fifth day. Speaking to The Indian Express, a person involved with a groups that sells fake information packs to create fraudulent digital trails said, “All that this job requires is minimal editing skills on platforms like Photoshop and entry-level computer knowledge to create a database of contacts on an Excel sheet and convert it into the vCard (a Virtual Contact File) format so thatAndroidphones can read them.” One such group on Telegram, named ‘Instant Loan Apps,’ has over 9,000 subscribers. “For those of you who did not know!! What is this channel for? Answer: You will get Bank SMS transaction data and call logs and contacts … with the help of this you will get approval in 7 days loan apps,” read a recent message on the group. In another Telegram group, named ‘Fake loan apps’, the directions were fairly simple: “do not use your primary phone… buy a clean phone… and install all the data we are sharing”. Fraudulent loan apps usually target borrowers by leveraging the personal data they collect from their phones. Besides loan apps requesting access to a borrower’s contact list, text messages, call logs and photo gallery, they also require a user to upload photos of their Aadhaar and PAN cards. Once a person gives necessary permissions and submits government-issued IDs, they are subjected to abuse and harassment during the recovery process. Fraudsters usually leverage two key details from theAadhaar card— father’s name and address — while harassing a borrower for loan repayment. A person involved with a Telegram group said, “Due to their very nature, most fraud loan apps don’t have a way to ping the Aadhaar registry to check whether the ID provided by a user is authentic.” The person added that recovery agents either extract the photo on the submitted Aadhaar Card or use the ID to shame the person publicly. The person said, “By submitting a fake Aadhaar Card that may have your name but an incorrect number and address, (you) can go a long way in ensuring that the fraudsters behind loan apps don’t harass you.” Explaining how the fake information packet helps fool a loan app, they said the fake text message data is compiled to mimic the texts a typical user’s phone would contain like bank transactions and promotional messages from various companies. “Loan apps look at such messages as a check to ensure that a person is constantly transacting or receiving money — a sign of an active bank account,” the person from the Telegram group said. While fake call logs ensure that a person’s phone number seems active, the fake contact list protects one’s real contacts who could be hounded by recovery agents later. The person from the Telegram group said that access to a borrower’s contact list serves a dual purpose for a fraud loan app. First, it allows recovery agents to reach out to a borrower’s contacts with abusive messages when the borrower defaults on the loan. Second, every contact in a borrower’s phone is a database of potential borrowers. Fraudsters send messages to a person’s contact, luring them with promotional offers that are too good to be true, in the hope that some of them will fall into their trap. There is collateral damage too. People who create fake call logs and contact lists usually purchase contact data in bulk. While several entries in such databases are non-working numbers, there are active numbers too. “Recovery agents may send harassing messages to people using active numbers, thinking they are related to the borrower,” the person from the Telegram group said. Since loan apps are aware of these steps being used to swindle them, they may reject a person’s loan application on the slightest suspicion of fake documents being used. And this is where “hunters” come in. These are people who “hunt” for apps that offer loans based on fake documents and data. The “hunters” then keep sharing information on such apps on their Telegram groups so that people can apply for loans using forged data. Talking about user safety while using an instant loan app, Sugandh Saxena, CEO, Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), said, “Be mindful of the privacy permissions you grant to a loan app. If a loan app seeks access to your photo gallery and contacts list, do not install it.”',\n",

              "       'Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA NageswaranStartups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said. Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala’s capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release. The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years. “In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,” he is quoted as having said in the release. He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country. “The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts. “Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,” he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality. He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages. Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities. “Apart from improved infrastructure and the government’s pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,” he said. He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business. “…but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,” he said. He also noted Kerala’s startup journey has been an inspiring one. The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena. KSUM is the Kerala government’s nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state. Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world’s top business incubators. The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India’s biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here. Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.',\n",
              "       'Fraud loan apps have a free run on social media platforms. Here’s howBharat Singh, a resident of the eastern village of Ghosi in Uttar Pradesh, borrowed Rs 15,000 for his sister’s wedding through a loan app he came across on Instagram called UnicashX. There was little guidance if this was a genuine lender. Instagram didn’t raise a red flag and nor did the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Singh didn’t suspect much since the app claimed it was backed by a non-banking financial company (NBFC), and NBFCs are regulated by the RBI. But soon enough, he had to pay a heavy price — not just usurious interest rates but also continuous mental harassment. UnicashX demanded Rs 50,000 back, more than thrice the borrowed amount. When Singh did not pay back beyond the Rs 15,000 borrowed, he received a message on WhatsApp, which left him terrified: “I will hurl such abuses at you that you will consume poison.” Over the days that followed, he was incessantly harassed on WhatsApp by unknown people. Singh is not alone. Over the last 11 years, the digital lending market has soared, and by 2023, it is estimated to have touched $350 billion, having grown at a compounded annual growth rate of almost 40 per cent, according to Experian, a credit information company. Of course, much of this is powered by genuine fintech companies backed by NBFCs and banks. But under the radar, hundreds of scrupulous players emerged. While there are no official estimates, industry players said the illegal lending market could be at least $700-800 million. Over the last four months,The Indian Expressspoke with a range of stakeholders including borrowers, fintech intermediaries, government functionaries, big tech companies and former RBI officials. A number of victims caught in the crosshairs of these apps and their testimonies point towards a common narrative: In the absence of any government and regulatory norms, online platforms carry out little due diligence and let fraudsters openly advertise predatory loan apps. The RBI doesn’t have a white list of registered loan apps, or even a negative list which is updated. Over the years, fraudulent firms mushroomed on the back of rapid growth in digital lending given its convenience. The government has not been able to bring stakeholders to agree on a set of guidelines to counter the menace. In fact, The Indian Express has reported around a dozen cases since 2020 where some of those caught in the trap of such illegal loan apps have allegedly died by suicide. The latest meeting to discuss the menace was held on October 13, with the Ministry of Finance, the RBI and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) participating. During the meeting, MeitY suggested that the RBI can design detailed know-your-customer (KYC) norms for lending apps, similar to the process that users have to follow before opening a bank account. “We refer to the process of company KYC as Know Your Digital Finance App (KYDFA),” Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar told The Indian Express. In September 2022, the RBI did release a set of guidelines for digital lending, but these were only for regulated entities — banks and NBFCs. So, whatever wrongdoing by a lending app and service provider (those engaged in recovery of loans among other activities), RBI will knock on the doors of the bank or the NBFC. But this doesn’t address the issue of fraudulent apps, which do not have any bank or NBFC association and thrive on a large pool of unsuspecting mid- to low-income people — including students, small shop owners, salaried people working with small establishments in Tier III and Tier IV cities — who are turned down by banks. The RBI did initiate some steps, but withdrew. In fact, in a meeting on illegal loan apps chaired by Union Finance MinisterNirmala Sitharamanin September 2022, it was decided that RBI would prepare a white list of legal lending apps and MeitY would ensure only these are hosted onGoogleandAppleapp stores. The RBI finds this “cumbersome” and hence has not moved on it so far, The Indian Express has learnt. Similarly, an RBI working group had in August 2022 proposed creating an independent multi-stakeholder body called the Digital India Trust Agency to verify digital lending apps. This agency, too, is yet to see the light of day. The RBI did not respond to a detailed questionnaire. With neither the government nor regulators looking over their shoulders, these fraudsters are abusing a confluence of the most popular online platforms — Meta, Google and Apple app stores, and WhatsApp — to advertise and distribute their dubious apps and eventually harass users for payments. Dubious loan apps advertise on Instagram andFacebook, and despite whatever filters they claim to use, many such apps including those clearly red-flagged by the government itself continue to offer their services. On October 11, this paper spotted an advertisement on both platforms for a loan app called Windmill. Just a month before, the app had been tagged as fake by the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Cyberdost initiative for having been hosted from “hostile foreign entities”. Google and Apple have blocked thousands of such apps from their app stores. But fraudsters find ingenious ways to find their way back online. For instance, when a user clicks on the ad by a dubious loan app called PaisaWorld on Instagram, she is redirected to a site asking her to download a program which looks deceptively similar to Google Play Store. Fake apps are good at deceiving Google and Apple about the nature of their services. They present themselves as mere loan calculators or loan aggregators, and, in one case, even a food recipe recorder, to fly under the radar of the companies’ review process. Apple took down an app called Cute Sweet Food Record and another called Kevin Basketball Train Plan which offered instant loans from a platform called Trust Loans after these were specifically flagged to it. These apps projected themselves as general health and fitness apps with no connection to loan services, Apple told The Indian Express. After a review, they maliciously changed their features and functionality. Responding to queries sent by The Indian Express, a Google spokesperson said the company “continuously updates policies across all our products to keep users safe from emerging threats and bad actors”. The company also said it does not allow apps attempting to deceive users or enable dishonest behaviour including but not limited to apps that misrepresent or do not accurately and clearly describe their functionality. But such apps continue to find a place on the Play Store. Meta did not respond to queries asking if the company reviews such advertisements before publishing them, and if it solely relies on automated means for the review or involves humans in the process. A government official said social media companies were not serious about monitoring advertisements of fake loan apps. “This is problematic; there is huge money to be made out of such advertisements. It is nothing else but corporate greed that they are not doing a better job at filtering out such ads,” said the official, requesting anonymity since the government is in continuous dialogue with Big Tech companies. A senior social media executive, however, said when the government cracks down on such activities, at times some legitimate apps, too, get affected. In February this year, when the Centre banned over 90 apps it believed to be fake, legitimate lending companies like KreditBee, LazyPay and Kissht, among others, faced the brunt. While the ban was revoked after the government went through their documentation, an executive whose app was banned at the time said such regulatory uncertainty will make it difficult for them to build credibility with customers. Bharat Singh, who continues to receive calls and harassment messages, said the loan app had taken him to UnicashX’s website. Here the app claimed it was backed by an NBFC called Kemex Engineering Ltd and also had a picture of its certificate from the RBI. “I believed the app and took out a loan for Rs 15,000. It was the biggest mistake of my life,” he said. Kemex is a RBI-registered NBFC. When The Indian Express contacted Vinay Shankar, the director of Kemex, he said: “We are not advancing any kind of loan via any digital lending applications.” He claimed to have no knowledge of UnicashX. Of course, legitimate NBFCs, too, are worried since it takes just a few rotten apples to spoil the basket. “Some of the RBI-registered and highly rated NBFCs have been misrepresented by illegal lending apps and there is real concern that the issue could snowball into a much bigger one for NBFCs, so there is a need to nip it in the bud,” said Raman Aggarwal, director of the NBFC industry body Finance Industry Development Council. Led by banks, NBFCs and fintech companies such asPaytm, Cred, Indifi and KreditBee, the total digital lending in 2023 is expected to be $80 billion, according to Experian. Ten years ago, this was $5 billion. Most digital lending apps are either owned by banks or NBFCs, or have a partnership with NBFCs. For instance, Paytm has partnered with NBFCs including Aditya Birla Capital, Hero Fincorp, Piramal Finance, Clix Capital and others. Cred has an in-house NBFC.',\n",

Adani to Fadnavis hail, but no official wordBillionaire Gautam Adani to two Union Ministers and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis among others on Sunday hailed India crossing $4 trillion mark though there was no official confirmation if the country has achieved the landmark. The finance ministry and the National Statistical Office did not immediately comment on the viral social media post on India’s GDP crossing $4 trillion. Highly placed sources said that the viral news was incorrect and India was still shy of that landmark. An unverified screengrab from the live tracking GDP feed for all countries based on International Monetary Fund data has been widely shared on social media, including by many including seniorBJPleaders. It is very difficult to have live tracking of GDP numbers of all countries as numbers of various sectors of the economy are available with a lag. “Congratulations, India. Another two years to go before India becomes the 3rd largest nation in terms of Global GDP by overtaking Japan at $4.4 trillion and Germany at $4.3 trillion. The Tricolour surge continues! Jai Hind,” Adani said on social media platform X. Many political leaders, including Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis hailed the achievement. “India’s moment of global glory as our GDP crosses $4 Trillion.The rise of #NewIndia under PM @narendramodi ji’s leadership is truly unparalleled,” Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said in a post on X. Another Cabinet minister, G Kishan Reddy in a post said, “Congratulations As The GDP Touches $4 Trillion For The First Time and Marches Ahead. On the course towards $5 Trillion Economy – Modi Ki Guarantee,” Reddy is Union Minister for Culture, Tourism and Development of Northeast Region as well as Telangana BJP president. Fadnavis also posted, “This is what dynamic, visionary leadership looks like ! That’s what our #NewIndia progressing beautifully looks like ! Congratulations to my fellow Indians as our Nation crosses the $ 4 trillion GDP milestone! More power to you, more respect to you Hon PM @narendramodi ji!.” D Purandeswari, BJP’s Andhra Pradesh president said, “Congratulations BHARAT on becoming a 4 Trillion Dollar Economy ! This phenomenal achievement has been made possible by the path breaking reforms introduced and implemented by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi Ji Government in the last 9.5 years.” India recorded GDP growth of 7.8 per cent during the April-June period of 2023-24, the highest in the past four quarters, on the back of double-digit expansion in the services sector, retaining its position as the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The 7.8 per cent GDP growth in the June quarter is higher than the 6.3 per cent recorded by China during the same period.

The leading player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) segment is also in talks with a leading domestic carrier for a long-term contract. The government is looking to divest AIESL, which has raked in an average annual revenue of around Rs 2,000 crore in the last three years. AIESL CEO Sharad Agarwal told PTI that the company has started doing checks for the aircraft of Kuwait Airways from September. “At present, AIESL carries out the maintenance works for the aircraft of various airlines, including Air India and SpiceJet…we are in talks with a leading carrier for a long-term contract. “Besides, discussions are going on with three to four foreign airlines for MRO works,” he said. Currently, a few planes of IndiGo are also serviced by AIESL. AIESL has also received approval from the government for carrying out certain checks for Boeing 737 MAX planes.According to its annual report for 2021-22, the company is planning to improve revenue generation by providing MRO services pertaining to existing capabilities to third parties (through aggressive marketing) and acquiring new capabilities. Various checks, including detailed structural inspections, as well as corrosion prevention works and structural repairs of aircraft are done by the company. At present, AIESL has around 5,300 employees, and the strength is likely to touch 6,000 by the end of this financial year. India is one of the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and domestic carriers have nearly 1,000 planes on order that are to be delivered in the coming years, which will also provide significant opportunities for MRO works.',\n",
              "       'Former RBI Governor S Venkitaramanan passes awayFormer Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), S Venkitaramanan, who managed the affairs at the central bank when the country faced two major crisis – balance of payment crisis that led to the pledging of gold and the securities scam triggered by Harshad Mehta – in the 1990-92 period passed away on Saturday after a brief illness. Venkitaramanan, 92, is survived by his two daughters and their families. He served as Finance Secretary in the Ministry of Finance for a period of four years from 1985 to 1989 when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister of the country. Venkitaramanan, who had finished his civil service career by 1990, moved on to Karnataka as an adviser to the Governor during President’s rule there, before taking over as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in December 1990 — an appointment that came on the back of Rajiv Gandhi’s support whose backing was critical for the survival of the then Chandra Shekhar government. In the early part of 1991, up to April-May, when the balance of payment crisis deepened — marked by Indian banks even being denied overnight borrowings from abroad, NRIs withdrawing deposits and a downgrade by global credit rating agencies — at the RBI, Venkitaramanan began working on the phone with various central banks. When these banks wanted collateral or security in the form of physical gold, which had to be transported to the UK, Venkitaramanan managed all of it, including getting the Indian customs not to insist on import clearances or licences for some of the boxes to transport the gold. The rapid depletion of India’s foreign exchange reserves, which by that time, at a little over $1 billion, was enough perhaps to cover just three weeks of imports. There was the secrecy of operations: the first tranche of the pledged gold (20 tonnes) helped raise $200 million as India went to polls in May 1991 after the tragic assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Another 47 tonnes of gold raised $400 million and subsequent measures by a new government led by Narasimha Rao marked an end to crisis management and firefighting then. According to many officials who worked with him during that period, as a crisis manager, Venkitaramanan was brilliant. Some though do say that his pro-growth and pro- industry or corporate stance also could have contributed to the build-up of the economic crisis in the mid to late 80s which he himself had flagged. What they are referring to is the period from 1984 to 1988-89, when the government followed an expansionary policy, which boosted growth but led to the crisis. That was the period when Venkitaramanan was the finance secretary. The securities scam involving then high-flying broker Harshad Mehta triggered a crisis in the stock markets and the banking system in 1990-91. Investors lost heavily as the stock market plummeted and the badla system was banned. Where he lost his sheen was after the securities scam of 1992: there was much criticism and he had to go after a two-year term — one of the shortest in the last three decades. His term as the RBI Governor ended on December 21, 1992. Expressing condolences, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “very sad to hear about the demise of S Venkitaramanan. He was an outstanding personality and public servant. Made immense contribution during periods of crisis. May his soul rest in ternal peace.” Many of India’s top politicians, civil servants and economists of that era are unanimous in their opinion that he was perhaps one of the brightest civil servants that the country has seen. Back in Tamil Nadu, where he began his career, he promoted many of the corporations and institutions when he was just a deputy secretary — relatively low down in the pecking order. And that was innovative thinking to ensure that Central government funds were available for the state to spend! Venkitaramanan was born in Nagercoil, which is now part of Tamil Nadu. He completed his Master’s degree in physics from University College Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. and also earned a Master’s degree in Industrial Administration from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, the USA.',\n",
              "       'US court rejects appeal against Cristiano Ronaldo’s hush money settlement in Las Vegas rape caseA US appeals court has denied claims made against Cristiano Ronaldo by Kathryn Mayorga and her lawyers to pay more money than the $375,000 in hush money he had after she accused him of raping her in 2009. Mayorga’s lawyer had asked the9th Circuit Court of Appealsto overturn the dismissal of the case in June 2022 and reopen the civil lawsuit she first filed in Nevada in 2018. The appeal argued the federal court judge in Nevada erred in repeatedly rejecting the victim’s attempts to unseal and include as evidence the confidentiality agreement she signed in 2010 in accepting payments from Ronaldo. This was disagreed by the three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based appellate court in the latest development. “The district court clearly recognized the gravity of dismissing the case and accordingly provided a thorough analysis, amply supported by factual findings,” Judge Johnnie Rawlinson wrote in Tuesday’s 6-page opinion per The Associated Press (AP). The case dates back to 2009 when Mayorga, a former teacher and Las Vegas based model, accused Ronaldo of sexually assaulting her in her bedroom. The Portuguese footballer and his lawyers have maintained their stance that the act between the two parties was strictly consensual. Last year, Judge Jennifer Dorsey in Las Vegas had levied\\xa0a $335,000 fine against Mayorga’s lead lawyer, Leslie Mark Stovall, for acting in “bad faith” in filing the case on his client’s behalf. “I find that the procurement and continued use of these documents was bad faith, and simply disqualifying Stovall will not cure the prejudice to Ronaldo because the misappropriated documents and their confidential contents have been woven into the very fabric of [plaintiff Kathryn] Mayorga’s claims,” Dorsey’s ruling had read. “Harsh sanctions are merited.”',\n",

              "       'Team India’s backroom staff includes a former maths teacher, a mountaineer, a former bus driver, an IT engineer, and a civic police volunteerParas MhambreyBowling coachA modern-day coach The 51-year-old has been head coachRahul Dravid’s trusted lieutenant since their India U-19 and India A team days. Having served as the head coach of Maharashtra, Bengal and Vidarbha he has also been with the National Cricket Academy. The pace pack loves the freedom he gives. Was originally brought into the fold to help with the transition phase the attack was going through in Tests and T20Is. Having implemented the workload management policy at the NCA, Dravid has been using this expertise in the lead-up to the World Cup. With a young crop of pacers – who he is familiar with thanks to his stint with U-19 and India A – Mhambrey is also putting the transition plan in place in red-ball cricket and T20Is. He doesn’t believe in spending too much time in team meetings, and instead likes to slip in all the data and analytics through the dashboard, which is on every player’s phone. In that sense, he is every bit a modern-day coach, who prefers to mix data with coaching manuals. Like his predecessor Bharat Arun, he has carried forward the five-bowlers theory at all costs. In the lead-up to the World Cup with star pacer Jasprit Bumrah injured, instead of grooming the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Shivam Mavi,Avesh Khan, it was Mhambrey who advocatedMohammed Shami’s inclusion, despite the seamer having played very few ODIs in the recent past. Vikram RathourBatting coachThe schedule-maker The only coaching staff to be associated with this team since Ravi Shastri & his men left the space. From the time he came on board after the previous World Cup, he has been harping about the need to be a lot more aggressive with the bat. And it is only at this World Cup that the world got to see the true potential and might of India’s line-up. Not the most gifted batsman during his playing days, after hanging up his boots, Rathour spent a few years in England before returning to coach Punjab and Himachal on the domestic circuit. He was also a national selector whenVirat Kohliwas captain. The 54-year-old is at the forefront of India’s training sessions, where he usually makes the schedule. A firm believer in giving batsmen freedom to go for shots irrespective of the format, Rathour has publicly backed the likes ofRohit Sharma,Rishabh PantandShreyas Iyerwhen they have been dismissed going for the big shots in Tests. Behind the scenes, he prefers to have one-on-one sessions with batsmen on almost a series-by-series basis. Not known to tinker much with their technique, but also the first to jump in and have a say at the nets if he sees something missing. To make it easier for the players, he instructs the team’s data analyst to video-record their net sessions and play it later on. He is known to seldom show his emotions and was even tipped to take a top role at the NCA. T DilipFielding coachFormer math teacher One who got extremely popular during the World Cup for introducing the ‘best fielder’s medal’ in the Indian dressing room, Dilip doesn’t have any cricketing background. With just tennis-ball cricket behind him, coaching became his calling from a young age. First up, he worked in age-group academies inHyderabadbefore he got a chance to work with Deccan Chargers in the IPL. At the now- defunct franchise, he would get a chance to be with renowned baseball coach Mike Young, who coached Australia in the past. And from there on, his graph kept moving upward. With no playing experience, Dilip would then enrol for a coaching programme at the NCA, where he would work with former India fielding coach R Sridhar. This was a period when he used to take maths tuitions to fund his coaching education and once he cleared the exams, became a regular face at the NCA. During the off-season, Dilip was a regular presence at the NCA zonal and annual camps, during which time he caught Dravid’s eye. Though Dravid had mostly worked with Abhay Sharma as the fielding coach during his stints with five Under-19 and A teams, the former India captain handpicked Dilip for the national team. With the Indian team, apart from maintaining the fielding standards set by Sridhar, his biggest contribution is how he has turnedKL Rahulinto a thorough wicketkeeper. With unique coaching gear, he has been spending hours together to get Rahul’s positioning right. Strength and conditioning Soham DesaiAn avid mountaineer  He started his foray in cricket with the Gujarat Ranji side between 2014-16. He spent a good part of 18 months working with a private fitness studio where he trained some popular personalities inChennaiunder the guidance of Shankar Basu, the former S&C coach, who was instrumental in improving fitness standards. From there, as the NCA revamped its S&C programme, Desai was at the forefront of it, spending four years at the academy before being promoted as assistant at the Indian team during the Covid years. Once Nick Webb vacated the seat, Desai, who’s an avid mountaineer, became the lead S&C coach after the 2021 T20 World Cup. S RajnikanthRehab master  A very popular figure, he is the one players turned to when they are undergoing rehab. Even when he was not associated with the NCA, injured players like Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer have sought him out to regain full fitness. Having been part ofDelhi CapitalsandGujarat Titansset- up in the past, Rajnikanth joined NCA recently, where he monitored the rehab programme of Bumrah, KL Rahul, Shreyas and Prasidh Krishna. Thanks to his relaxed training programme, he ensured everyone regained full fitness and with the World Cup in mind, the Indian team brought him on board to specially oversee these four players. Hari Prasad MohanVideo and data analystTeam’s eagle eye  A left-arm pacer, who gave up professional cricket to pursue a degree in engineering. Soon after completing bachelor’s degree in Information and technology, during which time he captained his college team, Hari joined Sportsmechanics which has been associated with the Indian team since 2000. Part of the backroom staff, he spent several hours studying footage before being part of the Tamil Nadu Ranji team. His biggest breakthrough came when CKM Dhananjay stepped aside as the Indian team analyst post the 2019 World Cup, and Hari stepped into his shoes. One can always spot him sitting with his laptop next to India’s coaching staff. He is the team’s eagle eye, who feeds the players the weakness and strengths of their opponents. Meticulous in detailing, he is a data man out and out. Rishikesh UpadhyayaLogistics ManagerDJ-in-chief  He has been Team India’s logistics manager for the past eight years. He was appointed by former BCCI president Anurag Thakur in 2015. Upadhyaya is a school friend of the former BCCI president and current Sports Minister of India. He also hails from Himachal Pradesh.

He is also the go-to person for the cricketers’ wives and children on tour. It is his responsibility that the families of the players are taken care of. This is Upadhyaya’s second stint with the team. He is also the go-to-man when players need some loud music to play in the dressing room, with his Punjabi collections being extremely popular among players. Masseurs Arun KanadeRelieving aches  Mumbai’s Arun Kanade has been part of the Indian cricket team for more than eight years now. He also had a stint with IPL sideRoyal Challengers Bangalore(RCB). Kanade shares a great rapport with Team India captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and other senior players. His main task is to ensure players’, especially bowlers’, muscles are relaxed before every game. Kanade had replaced the hugely popular Ramesh Mane, who was fondly addressed as ‘Mane Kaka’,and worked with the Indian team for close to a decade. Rajeev KumarMuscle Dr  Rajeev Kumar too is one of those support staff players contact immediately after the day’s play or during the innings break. Like Ranade, Kumar’s work starts after the match, when the players need to loosen up their muscles. Kumar shares a very good rapport with Team India’s pacers. Kumar, became popular on social media after Mohammed Shami shared a picture on Twitter celebrating his birthday alongsideIshant Sharmaand Kumar in 2019. Kumar celebrates his birthday on September 1, followed by Ishant’s on September 2, and Shami’s on September 3.

Throwdown specialists Raghavindraa DvgiKohli gives him credit  Aka Raghu, he is the senior-most among India’s three training assistants. Hailing from Kumta taluk in Uttara Kannada district, Raghu first became part of the Indian support staff back in 2011 during the tour of Australia. Endorsed by the likes ofSachin Tendulkarand Rahul Dravid, he had also attended the fabled Ramakant Achrekar summer camps for a couple of years. Such was his tenacity to play the sport that Raghu once even took shelter in a Hubli graveyard when he didn’t have a place to stay. His impact as a throwdown specialist can be gauged from what former skipper Virat Kohli once said, “I believe the improvement this team has shown while playing fast bowling since 2013 has been because of Raghu.” Nuwan SeneviratneEx-school bus driver  From Colombo, he is a former first-class cricketer who was part of the Sri Lankan set-up before he joined the Indian support staff in 2017. Unable to make more than two appearances on the domestic circuit back home, there was a time when Seneviratne earned his livelihood as a school bus driver. Cut to 2023, and he’s one of the key reasons behind India’s top order chiselling their skills against left-arm quicks. Was brought on board after India’s struggles against left-arm seamers seemed never-ending.

              "       'Coach Igor Stimac’s moves backfire as 0-3 defeat in World Cup qualifier to Qatar ends India’s 15-game unbeaten run at homeIt was hard to decipher India’s strategy against defending Asian champions Qatar at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. It was understandable that they wanted to defend against a team ranked 61st in the world, 41 places higher than them. But in a vital FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier, India coach Igor Stimac decided to bench goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, undoubtedly the best player the last two times India faced the 2022 World Cup hosts. Not just that, the Croatian made four changes among the outfield players from the team that stunned Kuwait 1-0 in the opening game of the campaign. The result of those changes was that India lacked coordination, especially when defending. And they were made to pay the price by their much taller, stronger, and in-sync opponents. The final scoreline read 0-3 but Stimac would know that the score could’ve been much more humiliating had Qatar converted even half of the chances they created. This was more than just a World Cup qualifier for India. It was also their toughest preparatory game ahead of the AFC Asian Cup in January, where similar or tougher tests await them. It was a chance for Stimac to show that India has attacking flair and a solid defence. But with Amrinder Singh replacing Gurpreet, the defence led by Sandesh Jhingan looked shaky from the start. Amrinder looked overawed by the occasion and responsibility. He had a nightmarish game with the ball at his feet, giving it away three times in the first half itself. Qatar were coming from a 8-1 thrashing over Afghanistan. Coached by Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal and Real Madrid, they almost took the lead in the second minute when a misplaced pass from Amrinder allowed their star striker Almoez Ali to walk into the Indian box and square it to Akram Afif. Just about four yards in front of goal, Afif fluffed his chance to send it wide much to the relief of the packed Kalinga Stadium, which had former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger in attendance. It didn’t take long for Qatar to redeem themselves, courtesy of some chaotic defending by India. Just two minutes later, India managed to head Afif’s corner out of the box, only for a Qatari player to send it back in. The ball pinballed in the Indian box and Udanta Singh’s failed clearance was met by the quick Mostafa Meshaal, who sent into the bottom corner. An early goal seemed to ease the pressure of the away match and Qatar kept displaying their attacking flair and prowess, launching attack after attack, with the Indian defence just about managing to hold out. Changes don’t work In the defensive set-up, Stimac brought in Anirudh Thapa for SahalAbdul Samad, and at left-back, he replaced Ashish Mishra with Subhasish Bose. Benching the in-form Mahesh Singh and starting with Udanta Singh was also a risk that didn’t pay off as India didn’t look threatening on counters. It was only after the half-hour mark that India started showing glimpses of what they are capable of. Probably their best move of the match came in the 35th minute when Thapa and Udanta played a series of one-twos to enter the Qatar box before Thapa pulled it back for Apuia Ralte waiting at the top of the area. TheMumbaiCity FC playmaker, who was easily India’s best player in the match, skied his shot into the stands. However, that attack gave India belief that they too could penetrate the Qatar defence, which leaked four goals against Iran in their last friendly. Thank you, Bhubaneswar for all your support tonight 💙 It means a lot. Always. 🇮🇳#INDQAT⚔️#FIFAWorldCup🏆#BlueTigers🐯#IndianFootball⚽pic.twitter.com/eKrEVX1kib — Indian Football Team (@IndianFootball)November 21, 2023 Thapa had India’s best opportunity of the match in the 42nd minute when Sunil Chhetri’s persistence helped him rob a Qatari defender and play the ball to Thapa. With just the goalkeeper to beat, Thapa tried to be cheeky and poke the ball from the edge of the box, but it was well wide of the target. Qatar doubled their lead in the first minute of the second half, as Almoez got on the scoresheet. Boualem Khouki sold Lallianzuala Chhangte a dummy and floated a lovely ball out to Afif waiting in the box. Afif smashed it at goal and Amrinder could only palm it under his body but Almoez, Qatar’s record goalscorer who scored four against Afghanistan, slid in to take his tally to 80 for his country. Stimac made two changes early in the second half, bringing in Mahesh in place of Udanta at the start and getting Sahal in place of Thapa a little later. It was then that India started combining well and looked threatening. Sahal had a good chance in the 65th minute, finding himself in acres of space inside the box after a brilliant through ball by Suresh Singh, but he dragged his left-footed shot wide, probably not realising how much time he actually had. Qatar put the game to bed in the 85th minute with substitute Yusuf Abdurisag scoring with the simplest of headers at the near post, and just like that, India’s15-game unbeaten run at home was broken. While they were certainly outplayed, they did show that it was possible to create chances against Asia’s best. They, however, need to find a striker capable of making a nuisance of himself against tough defences, for as it stands, Stimac’s men are yet to register a shot on target in more than 270 minutes (three matches) against Qatar.',\n",
              "       '‘He doesn’t have a brain, he’s lost it’: Hikaru Nakamura’s dig at Vladimir Kramnik over ‘garbage’ accusations of cheatingThe world of chess seemed to be heading towards another feud off the chess board after former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik presented new statistics on his Chess dot com profile that he purportedly believes reveals cheating by a player in blitz games. Kramnik, who has off late taken it upon himself to “expose cheating” in online chess games, frequently posts what he calls evidence for deceit in online games. While Kramnik didn’t name anyone in his allegations (which were then shared by GM Ian Nepomniachtchi on social media platform X), it led to American GM Hikaru Nakamura to hit back at the former world champion and Nepo in a lengthy Twitch stream on Tuesday where he took potshots at the former world champion Russian for “not having a brain.” The latest feud over alleged online cheating started off when Kramnik, in a post late on Monday, said: “Some small new piece of statistics, recently noticed, a player had scored 45.5 out of 46 CONSECUTIVE 3 minutes blitz games against approximately 2950 in average rating opposition (few different players) which is equivalent to 3600+ performance in those 46 Consecutive games. I believe everyone would find this interesting (SIC).” Hours after the tweet, Nakamura took to his Twitch account to live stream a rebuttal of sorts to the claims. He also said that Kramnik and Nepo had made disparaging comments about him away from the internet as well. “I don’t know what Kramnik’s thinking. At the end of the day, it’s very disappointing to see him doing this. I’m sure he’s going to go back and say he was just giving a stat and that it doesn’t mean anything. I know behind the scenes they (Kramnik and Nepomniachtchi) have said stuff about me. It’s hard to take this in good faith. I would hope he leaves it to the actual experts… the people who are mathematicians and statisticians, who do know what they’re doing,” Nakamura said in his stream. Vladimir appears to be referencing my record…is he really accusing me of cheating???@LevitovChess.@lachesisqare you jumping on this accusation as well by tweeting this garbage??https://t.co/NO17P0RH3H — Hikaru Nakamura (@GMHikaru)November 20, 2023 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Despite Kramnik not naming him, Nakamura explained how he figured out it was about him. “Kramnik was really stupid… If he wanted to do it in a way for it to be anonymous, he would have never put the average rating and the performance. Because there are about three players who can do it: Magnus Carlsen, Daniel Naroditsky (American GM) and me. Magnus hasn’t been playing that much online. If Kramnik actually had a brain, he would have found a way to do it without specifically listing it that way. But he doesn’t have a brain. He’s lost it,” said the American GM. Kramnik’s post was then shared on X by two-time world championship contender Ian Nepomniachtchi, who shared a screenshot of it, with the comment: “Because he’s the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.” Nakamura took offence to the claims and called the statistics “garbage”. Just last week, Nakamura broke the record for the highest blitz rating on Chess dot com with scores of 3336. Responding to Nepo’s tweet, Nakamura said: “Vladimir appears to be referencing my record…is he really accusing me of cheating??? … Are you jumping on this accusation as well by tweeting this garbage??” Responding to a comment from a fan on his livestream asking him to challenge Kramnik to a blitz game, Nakamura said: “What’s the point? Kramnik’s not doing anything in good faith anymore. I don’t think anybody should play Kramnik in blitz, cause all he’s doing is using those games to compile garbage stats and trying to claim that online chess is completely broken. I would never play Kramnik. Period!” While it remains to be seen how Nepo and Kramnik respond to the rebuttal video and the tweet, this will certainly spice up their upcoming battle at the FIDE Candidates tournament in April next year, where Nepo and Nakamura will be two of the top players vying for the chance to challenge World Champion Ding Liren for the crown next year. Besides the duo, the India pair of Vidit Gujrathi and Praggnanandhaa R are also in the fray. Just two months back, Kramnik had declared that he will not play games on Chess dot com anymore due to “too many obvious cheaters” on the platform. Even back then, he had refrained from naming any player. But it came on the back of controversy around American GM Hans Niemann, who had only recently agreed to a ceasefire with former world champion Magnus Carlsen. The World No 1 Carlsen had alleged that Niemann had been cheating in over-the-board games against him, which had led to a lawsuit, which also involved Nakamura as he had amplified Carlsen’s allegations against Niemann. Eventually, the suit was settled out of court. The Russian legend has said: “I promise I will continue trying my best to save chess from this disease.”',\n",

Having impressed with their takedown of former World Cup champions in England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Afghanistan will visit the country in January for a three-match T20I series. The first of the three games shall be played on January 11, 14 and 17. The series will be sandwiched between the India’s tour of South Africa – three T20Is, as many ODIs and two Tests – and the five-Test series against England at home starting early February. It’ll be a first-ever three-match T20I series between the two nations. The two teams have played five T20Is against each other so far, with India having won four of them while their last contest – a gold medal match at Asian Games in Hangzhou – ended with no result. India however, were deemed winners being the higher seeded team going into the final.

              "       'Stop-clock to speed up play, banning transgenders from women’s cricket: Decisions at ICC board meetingThe International Cricket Council’s board met in Ahmedabad on Tuesday where it came up with a new gender eligibility regulation, pay parity for umpires, introduction of a stop clock on trial basis to speed up play and to move the ICC men’s U-19 World Cup from Sri Lanka to South Africa. Here are the key takeaways. Stop-clock trial Six years after the MCC’s cricket committee – that included the likes ofRicky Ponting,Kumar SangakkaraandSourav Ganguly– recommended a ‘shot clock’ to prevent teams from wasting time, the ICC board has introduced a stop-clock system. Under this regulation, which will come into effect from December 1 and continue till April 2024, a clock will be used to regulate the amount of time taken between overs. So how does it exactly work? Once an over is finished, the fielding team will have to be ready within 60 seconds to bowl the next over. The match officials will start the stop-clock once an over is called. “If the bowling team is not ready to bowl the next over within 60 seconds of the previous over being completed, a five-run penalty will be imposed the third time it happens in an innings,” the ICC said. What is the need for a stop-clock? Simply, to improve over rates. Last year, taking cue from T20 leagues, the ICC introduced an in-game penalty in ODIs and T20Is. As per the existing rule, if the fielding side is behind the clock by the time the innings is supposed to be finished, they have to bring in an additional fielder inside the 30-yard circle for those many overs. But despite this, there were numerous instances where teams still lagged behind. Now with the introduction of a stop-clock and five penalty runs, teams would be punished more heavily in the match itself, while the old monetary fines will continue to be applicable. No transgenders in cricket Similar to what other sports bodies have done, the ICC has revised its transgender policy. Under the new regulations, any player who has transitioned from male to female and has been through any form of male puberty will not be allowed to participate in women’s international cricket, regardless of any surgery or gender reassignment treatment they may have undertaken. What was ICC’s earlier criteria? Earlier, a transgender woman had to keep testosterone serum to 5 nanomoles or below for a period of 12 months. This was in line with the International Olympic Committee’s recommendations. But with the IOC recommending that each sport come up with its own policies, the ICC has revised its stand. The new rule means Canada’s Danielle McGahey, who became the first transgender player to feature in international cricket earlier this year, will no longer be eligible to play women’s cricket. McGahey, originally from Australia, had fulfilled ICC’s old criteria that made her eligible to play in the Women’s T20 Qualifiers for the 2024 T20 World Cup. How do other sports deal with the issue World Athletics says no transgender athlete who had gone through male puberty would be permitted to compete in female world ranking competitions. FINA – swimming’s world governing body – also stops transgender athletes from competing in women’s elite races if they had gone through any part of the process of male puberty. In 2020, World Rugby became the first international sports federation to say transgender women cannot compete at the elite and international level of the women’s game. Under-19 World Cup in South Africa With Sri Lanka Cricket placed under suspension because of government interference, the ICC has moved next year’s Men’s Under-19 World Cup to South Africa. Though it gave the nod for Sri Lanka to compete internationally in bilateral and ICC events, the country has been stripped of hosting rights of the age-group competition, which would be a definite blow to their economy that is dependent on tourism and hospitality. While UAE was also considered as a possible host, since the tournament clashes with ILT20 in the Emirates, the ICC picked South Africa as it has a range of venues. The Rainbow Nation had hosted the event in 2020, when India made it to the final and lost to Bangladesh. The 16-team tournament will commence in the second week of January and run till the first week of February at four venues. With SA20 also scheduled to run simultaneously, it is not clear yet which venues will stage the U-19 World Cup. Pay parity The Chief Executives’ Committee (CEC) of the ICC endorsed a plan to accelerate the development of female match officials. This includes, having equal match day pay for ICC umpires across men’s and women’s cricket. And from January 2024, in every ICC women’s championship series, there will be one neutral umpire.',\n",
              "       'After suspending Sri Lanka Cricket, ICC snatches away 2024 Men’s U19 World Cup from island nationThe International Cricket Council (ICC) have replaced Sri Lanka as hosts for the Men’s U19 World Cup scheduled to be played next year and appointed South Africa to stage the tournament. The decision comes as a result of cricket’s world governing body controlling the fundings made to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) after it had suspended the national board for breaching its obligations as a member, namely for failing to manage its affairs autonomously and without government interference. Cricket South Africa (CSA) had hosted the event in 2020 as well, with the games being hosted in Kimberley, Bloemfontein, Potchefstroom and Benoni. Earlier this year, the Women’s T20 World Cup was also hosted in the country, which is going to host the next ODI World Cup in 2027. The previous U19 World Cup had been staged in the Caribbean and won by India, who clinched the title for a fifth time. Why the ICC had suspended SLC? The development had come on the heels of a turbulent World Cup campaign by the islanders, where they failed to progress through to the knockouts and won just the two games from their nine league stage outings. Following the dismal performance from the Sri Lankan men’s team at the ODI World Cup in India, Sri Lankan Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe had sacked the SLC management and appointed former World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga as the head of a seven-member interim committee to govern the cricket board. However, that was overturned by the Court of Appeal. Later in the week, the Sri Lankan parliament had unanimously passed a resolution demanding the sacking of SLC. Parties from both sides of the aisle had supported it. That resolution, passed by Sri Lankan parliament, was what irked the ICC, who have it in their guidelines to oversee an autonomous running of its member boards.',\n",

Walking out to bat at a popping Narendra Modi Stadium with Australia three wickets down for 47 in the World Cup final is a feeling he won’t ever forget. In his latest newsletter titled ‘My World Cup Final Wrap’, the Aussie number four went on to share some snippets on the atmosphere inAhmedabadafter India nabbed early wickets and looked in the game on Sunday, and how he copped with the same. “It was so loud and the wave of momentum India had was immense. The Indian team were getting into me and all I could say back, and very truthfully at that, was ‘I actually can’t hear what you’re saying over the crowd’,” Labuschagne conceded. “On this bus ride to the ground, there was fans lining the streets from about 5km out. It was amazing to see the fans get behind the game like they did.” If anything, the loud atmosphere helped the five-time champions to add a sixth world title. “A sea of blue in the crowd. Chills as the anthem plays.. a real ‘us vs. the world’ feeling. The underdog spirit we love.” The 29-year-old went on to add 192 runs for the fourth wicket alongside Travis Head as Australia emerged victorious by six wickets – the foundation for which was laid by the bowlers restricting India for 240. A performance that had led to the Motera crowd going silent. “Standing in the middle of a giant stadium with 130,000 fans in it who all went silent at this moment. We all just stood in the team huddle and took it in for a moment,” Labuschagne said of the ambiance around the venue afterVirat Kohli’s dismissal. However, it’s the wicket of the Indian captainRohit Sharmathat Labuschagne puts as a pivotal moment in the game. Despite the loss of Shubman Gill in the powerplay, Rohit had delivered anotherone of his classic quickfire starts at this tournament – 47 off 31 before he miscued one over the infield on the off side only for Travis Head to nab him. “It was huge in the context of the game. For Maxi to throw it up like he did and tempt Rohit into the shot, and then Heady to take this grab. It was massive.”',\n",

The Madurai native, who has now shifted base toHyderabadalong with his mother Prabhavati to train, won his maiden U-19 All India Ranking title with the Smt Krishna Khaitan Memorial Trophy. “While I had won the Bahrain Junior International Series earlier this year, I had not won a domestic All India Ranking U-19 singles’ title. The semi-final win over top-seed Dhruv Negi had set the tone for me for the final and it was unfortunate that my opponent had to withdraw due to an injury with me leading in the final. My father stays in Madurai to manage his brick business while mother stays in Hyderabad with me. I dedicate the trophy to both my parents,” Ram toldThe Indian Express. For Haryana youngster Anmol Kharb, it was a day for double delight as the Faridabad native first paired up with Vennala K of Telangana to score a 17-21, 21-15, 21-11 win over the pair of Taarini Suri and Shravani Walekar of Maharashtra before winning the girls’ singles title with a close win over Punjab youngster Tanvi Sharma. The doubles win meant that the pair of Kharb/Vennala won their first U-19 doubles title together and claimed the Rachel Goenka Trophy. It was Kharb’s first doubles title, who normally plays on the singles’ circuit. “It was a tough day for me as I had to compete in two finals but I am glad that I won both the titles. It’s my first U-19 doubles title of my career and I hope to win more such titles,” said Kharb. Kharb’s doubles partner Vennala K hails fromGuntur, Andhra Pradesh, and started playing badminton at the insistence of her father Sriniwas Reddy, who works as a ticket checker in Indian Railways and is a former ball badminton national player. The Gopichand Academy trainee is also a fan of world number and Asian Games champion doubles pair of Satwik Sairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. “I started playing badminton at the insistence of my father, who is a ball badminton player and would see my elder brother Lokesh Reddy play badminton too. We were playing together for the first time and to win the title along with Anmol feels special for both of us,” said the youngster, who was cheered by her father on the courtside. For 17-year-olds Mayank Rana of Sonepat, Haryana, and Sanskar Saraswat of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, it was also the first time of playing together in the tournament. The doubles pair eked out a 21-15, 21-16 win over the pair of Rohan Anandas of Telangana andRahul DravidBatti of Andhra Pradesh to claim the boys’ doubles title and the Anant Goenka Trophy. Rana, whose father Vikas Kumar works as a teacher, started playing badminton for fitness. “I was fascinated by badminton and when I took up the sport seriously, my father would take me to the badminton academies in Sonepat. Later, he decided to send me to train at Gopichand Academy in 2020. I play singles as well as doubles and playing in both the categories helps me mentally as well physically too,” said Rana, who had earlier reached the final and semi-finals of a couple of All India Junior Ranking Tournaments with different partners. The pair won their maiden Junior Ranking U-19 title too with the win on Monday. After the win, Sanskar Saraswat was busy talking over the phone with his father Raj Saraswat, a former badminton player and now a coach. “While Mayank and I have been training at Gopichand Academy for the last three years, we had paired up for the first time for this tournament. After the win, we plan to continue the partnership for next year too and we expect to win more such titles. Like others, we too are big fans of the world number pair of Satwik Reddy and Chirag Shetty,” said Saraswat. For Kanchipuram native Pravandhika R, Monday brought her first mixed doubles title along with Bharath Sanjai of Tamil Nadu as the mixed doubles pair eked out a 21-12, 21-11 win over the top-seed pair of Bhavya Chhabra and Manya Ralhan ofDelhiand Punjab. The mixed doubles pair, who claimed the Sasha Goenka Trophy, sounded ecstatic after the title win. “My father E Raghavan is a coach in Kanchipuram and badminton was the only thing which I looked forward to playing in my childhood. I mostly play doubles and we both were pairing for the first time here. To win against the top seed for our maiden title feels special for both of us,” said 17-year-old Pravandhika. Her partner 18-year-old Sanjai of Coimbatore too ended a title drought after a few final finishes in the All India Junior Ranking Tournaments. “I guess this venue is lucky for me. I had partnered with different partners and we reached the finals including tournaments at Bahadurgarh andChandigarh. Playing at the national level also helps one’s confidence and I am glad that we won a title at the year-end,” said Sanjai, whose father too is a badminton coach. Chandigarh youngster Rijul Saini won the N Haridass Rolling Trophy for being adjudged as the tournament’s best player (girls) while Lalthazuala H of Mizoram was adjudged as the best player of the tournament (boys) and claimed the Aiyappa Trophy. Tenth-seed Saini had lost to eventual winner Anmol Kharb in the girls’ semi-final on Sunday while Lalthazuala lost against Pranauv Ram in the boys’ final. Ankit Malik of Haryana was adjudged as best boys’ player of Haryana winning the Aggarwal Trophy while Medhavi Nagar of Haryana was adjudged as the best girls’ player of the state and won the Neera Dutt Trophy. In the past, London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal had won the girls’ singles title in 2005 while double Olympics medallist P V Sindhu won the title in 2010. Last year, Bharat Raghav had won the boys’ singles title while Tara Shah had won the girls’ singles title in the tournament. National coach Pullela Gopichand’s wife P V V Laxmi had become the first girls’ singles winner in the tournament in 1991. “The tournament had seen more than 1,150 entries this year and like in the past, we are glad that we saw the emergence of some budding talents like Anmol Kharb, Tanvi Sharma and Pranauv Ram apart from others. We will also select players for the National Academy for Juniors atGuwahatifrom this tournament,” said Sanjiv Sachdeva, former Indian chief junior coach and member, selection committee, Badminton Association of India, and tournament director.',\n",

              "       'Why the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup format we saw in 2023 is not good for the gameAt the end of 48 matches where Australia, perhaps inevitably, were crowned champions, there is a lingering question that the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup leaves us with. What is a “World Cup” supposed to be? This is not to be confused with the questions surrounding the 50-over format itself. That is for another day. This is also not supposed to be about India not being able to win the ICC title that has eluded them for more than a decade now, despite all the resources at their disposal. Trying to answer that will take a whole week. This is, at its heart, a question surrounding what a tournament of this magnitude is supposed to mean for the game. Because, as it stands, the last two editions of this tournament have been played in a format that is rigged to favour the best teams to rise to the top. It is not a format meant for fairytales. It is not one designed for shock and awe because the shocks are almost always temporary and the awe is fleeting. It is a tournament where teams fight it out for a league phase that seems to last forever followed by just three knockout matches. Sure, there can be a school of thought that goes: yes, the best teams will surely now play each other in the end. A World Cup is for the best teams, is it not? But cricket is already so restrictive in featuring just 10 teams (for the men, the women still only have 8 teams). The “World” barely exists in the World Cup as it is, and this format has almost nearly rendered the “Cup” meaningless. Essentially, it is a Champions League. That is why the Netherlands defeating South Africa – a result that had far-reaching consequences in the slightly more global T20 World Cup – barely caused a ripple at CWC23. That is why Afghanistan defeating Pakistan – a momentous, generation-defining result for a team on the rise – meant nothing in the larger scheme of things. Australia losing two matches, New Zealand losing four matches meant only the order of top four was ever in question – and that too, not for very long. This is no slight on Australia’s recovery or New Zealand’s ability to find an optimum level of operation to reach the business end. They did just what they had to do in a tournament that allowed them breathing space to recover from setbacks. But on the flip side, it is impossible to escape the fact that this is essentially a format that enables broadcasters and powers-that-be to bank on at least nine guaranteed matches for the likes of India, Australia, and England. The game itself is more global, so comparing cricket with football is perhaps too simplistic. And followers of football would tell you that the Fifa World Cup format will soon have its issues too. But, at the very least, it is a tournament that allows for miracle moments. It lets the mighty powerhouses in the world to feel the pressure of an early defeat. Some recover like Argentina did last year after losing to Saudi Arabia. Others can’t, as we have seen many times in the past but more recently with Morocco and Japan making the most of outperforming giants like  Belgium and Germany. Those huge wins for the lesser-favoured meant something immense. Even some of the most incredible Cricket World Cup matches from the past have been knockouts. The highs of the 1996 quarterfinal between India and Pakistan in Bengaluru followed by the shock of the semifinal inKolkata. South Africa’s many incredible semifinal (defeats). Australia – after having won in 1999, 2003, 2007 – finally letting the crown slip, at the hands ofYuvraj Singh-inspired India inAhmedabad. Even in the just concluded edition where Head broke hearts in the final, there is a strong case to be made for the two most exciting matches – the most tense, the ones with most at stake – to be the two semifinals. The 70-run margin wouldn’t fool any of us into thinking the India win against New Zealand came at a canter inMumbai. The South Africa-Australia clash in Kolkata would go into the annals of famous matches in the tournament’s history. Sure there were a few thrillers smattered here and there during the league stage, but as mentioned earlier, the result of most of the group matches just couldn’t have the same impact on a tournament. Simply, that sort of jeopardy simply isn’t possible when the focus of a Cricket World Cup is to dedicate the majority of the eyeballs for the big teams, with 3 knockout matches out of 48 in total. In 2027, there will be at least a minor course correction with the men’s ODI World Cup tournament going up to 14 teams. But as per ICC, the format is set to two groups of seven, with the top three in each group progressing to a Super Six stage: yet again minimising the possibility of a major team exiting early barring a disaster. Unless and until the focus shifts from maximising air time for the game’s behemoths to actually producing a tournament that has more knockouts, more possibilities for the underdog, and more thrill for a neutral, the Cricket World Cup will remain a misnomer.',\n",
              "       'Chennai scare against Australia saw Team India opt for sluggish track for World Cup finalThe scare that India got in their first World Cup game against Australia at Chennai prompted the Indian team management to opt for a sluggish pitch for the final in Ahmedabad. However, this would prove to be the home team’s folly as Australia was able to break India’s unbeaten 10-win streak. In India’s opening game of the World Cup, Aussie pacers Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc had reduced the hosts to 2/3. And hadMitchell MarshpouchedVirat Kohli’s skier off a Hazlewood ball soon afterwards, it would have been 20/4. The Australians were defending only 199 and the fielding lapse turned out to be terminal. India would go on to win the game easily but the scars of the trip toChennaistayed. The Indian Expresshad learnt that ahead of the final, the Indian think tank was worried that if the Aussie pacemen could give them a bloody nose on a spinner’s paradise at Chepauk, the consequences could be far worse if the conditions were even slightly in their favour in the final. That was the reason the Indian team management opted for the pitch that was used for the Pakistan game. That slow surface was as un-Australian as possible. Besides aiding their spinners, the pitch minus pace helped skipperRohit Sharmain taking the attack to the opposition during the first Powerplay. With the surfaces not yielding much pace or movement to the seamers, Rohit could afford to hit through the line, and even step down the track to disturb the bowlers’ length. The fast starts he provided allowed the later batsmen to settle in without worrying too much about the run rate. Even in the final, Rohit was the main reason India reached 80 after the first 10 overs, even though they lost three wickets in the process. But the tactic would backfire and India played right into the Aussie hands. The track became too sluggish for India’s liking, their batsmen struggling to find any sort of rhythm in the afternoon against the assortment of cutters, slower balls, off-pace bouncers and hard-length balls, while becoming much better to bat on under lights. Under the sun, the Virat Kohli-KL Rahulpartnership had far tougher conditions to face as compared to the time when Travis Head and Manus Labuschagne milked the Indian bowling in the evening. The Australians seemed to know what type of pitch would be on offer and were well prepared for the challenge. The home team, on the other hand, seemed surprised and out of sync with the kind of pitch on which they had been bred from an early age. India got pitches that suited their strength throughout the World Cup. It worked perfectly for a month and a half – all parts of the Indian cricketing ecosystem seemingly pulling inone direction– before backfiring spectacularly against the supremely-determined and prepared Australians in the biggest match of them all. It showed in India’s itinerary as well as the hosts played their league games against Australia, England, Pakistan and South Africa on the spin-friendly surfaces of Chennai,Lucknow,AhmedabadandKolkata, while the Sri Lankans, who didn’t have too strong a seam attack, were sent toMumbai, where the twilight hour made batting a hazardous exercise. It was a common sight at every venue to see head coachRahul Dravidexamining the pitch closely, with reports of the team management’s demands regarding every playing surface coming out in public domain. According toDaily Mail, the ICC’s chief pitch consultant Andy Atkinson was virtually sidelined from the process at venues where the hosts were to play and wrote to the world body wondering whether the pitch for the India-New Zealand semifinal at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium was the best choice after the track was switched just days before the game. After the Chennai game against Australia, the home team went from strength to strength, looking unbeatable and unstoppable, but when their opponents in the final were confirmed, their anxieties came to the fore. The Aussies were much smarter and more resourceful than the Indians imagined, morphing into whatever shape they needed to take as per requirement while exposing the weaknesses in the Indian runaway train that had been papered over during their unbeaten run – lack of batting depth, dependence on a few players to lead the way, and inability to adapt to changing conditions.',\n",

Of his 24 wickets in thisWorld Cup, only one came in the final against Australia. “The Prime Minister told us that since we all had given our 100 per cent, we shouldn’t be disappointed. He said win or loss wasn’t in one’s hand, what was important was we played well and tried hard,” said a team member on the condition of anonymity. Shami took to social media and said he was thankful for the support the team got during the World Cup.“Unfortunately yesterday was not our day. I would like to thank all Indians for supporting our team and me throughout the tournament. Thankful to PM @narendramodi for specially coming to the dressing room and raising our spirits. We will bounce back!” he posted on X. Jadeja also acknowledged how the nation stood by the team that lost in the final. “We had a great tournament but we ended up short yesterday. We are all heartbroken but the support of our people is keeping us going. PM @narendramodi’s visit to the dressing room yesterday was special and very motivating.” Modi watched the action from the ground during the second innings with Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. Also present was Home Minister Amit Shah. Before Modi’s arrival in the dressing room, coach Dravid had a chat with the team. He pointed to the positives and advised the players to move on. With his coaching contract ending with the World Cup, Dravid and the Indian board officials will be in talks in the coming days before a final decision on his assignment is taken. In his post-match press conference, the seemingly drained out Dravid said he was undecided about his future as India coach. “Honestly, I haven’t thought about it. I think all our campaign, all our energies were focused on this match, focused on this tournament, and focused till here. And I haven’t actually given it any thought. I have no plans of what’s going to happen in the future,” he stated. He also shared the mood of the dressing room. “He’s (Rohit) disappointed, as are many of the boys in the dressing room. There was a lot of emotion in that dressing room. It was tough to see as a coach, because I know how hard these guys have worked, what they’ve put in, the sacrifices they’ve made. So, it’s tough. It’s tough to see that as a coach, because you get to know these boys personally. You get to see the effort they put in, the hard work that we’ve put in over the last month.” After the game, Rohit was seen hiding his teary face under the cap. Mohammad Siraj, dragging his feet, also broke down.',\n",

Raman posted a carousel of photographs on her Instagram account after Australia defeated the Indian cricket team by six wickets in the Cricket World Cup final at theNarendra ModiStadium inAhmedabad. The photos also included a message for fans. “aaaaand cue all the hateful vile DMs. Stay classy… Can’t believe this needs to be said BUT you can be Indian and also support the country of your birth where you have been raised and more importantly the team your husband plus father of your child plays in #nobrainer. Take a chill pill and direct that outrage towards more important world issues (SIC),” the Indian-origin Raman wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. Raman, who is a pharmacist, married Maxwell last year and the couple have a young baby. Maxwell got Australia a crucial breakthrough in the final against India by getting the wicket of highflyingRohit Sharma, who was batting on 47. That wicket took the wind out of India’s sails. He wasn’t needed to do too much with the bat with Travis Head scoring 137 runs and more or less assuring a sixth World Cup trophy for Australia by the time Maxwell came in to bat.

How can we imagine what our needed quality is in 2030? But what is for sure, is where we start with technique,” Wenger said. “Football is a technical sport. We have to equip the players from five to 15 with the best possible capacity to be technically at the top. That means, basically, to make it simple, is to make the ball his friend. The rest can be developed later. And this is absolutely vital.” Wenger cited the example of Japan, where he had been a coach with Nagoya Grampus before his move to Arsenal. “I was in Japan at the start of their football in 1995. In 1998, they were at the World Cup. So that means it is possible. You have to start early,” he said. Wenger and his team from the FIFA Talent Development Scheme are currently on a three-day visit to India in connection with the AIFF-FIFA Academy to be inaugurated in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. The AIFF said  Wenger visited the Football House on Monday and had an interaction with the heads of a select group of football academies from across the country. Wenger said there is a “gold mine” of football talent in India that needs to be tapped so that the country can play a more significant role on the world stage. “My target is to improve football in the world. And it is impossible that a country like India, 1.4 billion, is not on the football world map,” the 74-year-old said. “My main target here is to convince people that there is a gold mine here, but at the moment it is not completely explored, exploited, and encouraged.” Wenger, who once oversaw an unbeaten Premier League season for Arsenal during a glittering coaching career, said that India has the resources to make it work. The Indian team have never participated in the history of the Fifa World Cup. “I believe you have huge assets, and fantastic qualities that make me very optimistic about what you can do here. It is absolutely fantastic to have that opportunity. And with my team, we are really highly motivated to help this country develop in the game. I’m convinced that it’s possible in the very short term.”',\n",
              "       'World Cup qualifiers: Sunil Chhetri-led Indian football team hopes to punch above its weight against Asian Champs QatarThe last time India grabbed a point from Qatar, the Gulf country created as many as 27 chances, the Indian defenders had to make 36 tackles and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a stunning 11 saves as India held the Asian champions to a goalless draw. It was four years ago, in the second round of World Cup and Asian Cup joint qualifiers. Much has happened since that game in Doha. A 10-man India lost their ‘home’ tie which had Doha as a centralised venue due to Covid restrictions, and the not-so-small matter of Qatar having hosted and played in a World Cup. As the two teams meet again at the same stage of the qualifiers, this time in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday, a lot has changed. India too have gone from strength to strength under coach Igor Stimac, with the 1-0 win away at Kuwait last week a testimony to it. But it’s nothing compared to the spur in growth Qatar have seen, especially since successfully hosting the World Cup. So when India host Qatar on Tuesday in their second match of the FIFA World Cup 2026 and AFC Asian Cup 2027 Preliminary Joint Qualification Round 2, it may seem like a battle of unequals but the hosts will go into the game with a belief that they can continue to punch above their weight. Before harbouring hopes of an upset victory though, India must figure out how to get a shot at the Qatar goal. In both their previous games, the Blue Tigers haven’t managed a single shot on target. Indeed, they defended resolutely and the stats speak for themselves, but the game on Tuesday is much more than a qualifier — it’s more about how India stand against Asian heavyweights, keeping in mind the all-important AFC Asian Cup in January next year. India have already shown a glimpse that they can go toe-to-toe against the better Asian sides, and their 2-2 draw against Iraq in September is a testament to that. The fact they won three trophies in 2023 – the Tri-Nations Series, Intercontinental Cup and the SAFF Championship – simply shows the steady improvement India have made. The youngsters especially. The under-23 men’s side reaching the round of 16 at the Asian Games after 13 years in arduous circumstances wasn’t seen as a one-off. They will also take courage from the fact that they haven’t lost a single game at home this year. “When you play high-level games consecutively without losing, facing Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait three times, Lebanon twice, Iraq and you don’t lose matches and keep clean sheets, it’s quite evident that you are consistent,” Stimac said ahead of the Qatar match. Nothing however would give them more confidence than their 1-0 victory over Kuwait in the first match of these qualifiers last week, courtesy of a brilliant goal by striker Manvir Singh. While India did beat Kuwait at home, beating them on their own turf would’ve been unthinkable even five years ago. It may have been their first World Cup qualifying win on foreign soil for the first time in 22 years but Stimac wants them to forget that victory. The Croatian believes, and one would tend to agree with him, that a positive result against Qatar is the only way forward. “I said to our players immediately after the Kuwait game in the dressing room that the best thing is to forget this game immediately. Save your energy from celebrating, being overconfident, and getting into euphoria. No, forget it. Let’s get preparing for the Qatar game. That’s the only way forward,” said Stimac. Qatar flexed their muscles in the 8-1 drubbing of Afghanistan to start the Asian Qualifiers in some style. Four of those goals came from the boots of their record top-scorer Almoez Ali, who was the MVP at the 2019 Asian Cup, and the Indian defence marshalled by Sandesh Jhingan is bound to have a busy time in keeping him silent. India would want to look at the games before the Afghanistan match though. Qatar were drubbed 4-0 by Iran and held 1-1 by Russia in their two friendlies since September. But coached by the experienced Carlos Queiroz, who has managed the likes of Iran, Portugal, and a club like Real Madrid, they will want to continue their momentum from the Afghanistan match. They, too, would be looking at these matches as a preparation for their home Asian Cup and given how poor their World Cup campaign went (they couldn’t get a point), they would look at the January tournament as some sort of redemption. Stimac made a brave call in the Kuwait game, benching the pacy Lallianzuala Chhangte, who ironically came in and set up the goal for Manvir, the player who started in his place. With Manvir scoring, it’ll be difficult for Stimac to bench him against Qatar. While he went for an attacking lineup against Kuwait, he could go for a more defensive approach on Tuesday which could mean the talismanic playmaker SahalAbdul Samadmight have to make way for Anirudh Thapa. That would be unfortunate since Sahal has been electrifying in the Indian jersey and the majority of their attacks have come through him. Stimac however said on the eve of the match that he’s going to go all out. “It’s a game, where there is nothing to lose for us but a lot to win for. So let’s go for it all out,” he said. “We cannot control the external factors. We can only control our performances at the individual level and as a team. The only thing for us to do is to give our best for 90 minutes when the first whistle sounds.”',\n",

AsThe Indian Expresshad reported, it is likely that the ankle injury will keep Pandya out for at least another two months. This means he will miss the upcoming T20I series at home against Australia and is also likely to miss three T20Is and three ODIs in South Africa.

              "       'Haryana’s Anmol Kharb looking to walk in Saina Nehwal’s footstepsIt was moments after her fighting 21-13, 21-23, 21-16 win over Tanvi Sharma of Punjab in the girls’ U19 singles final of the Yonex Sunrise 30th Smt Krishna Khaitan Memorial All India Junior Ranking Prize Money tournament being organised by Express Shuttle Club Trust at the Tau Devi Lal Sports Complex. But the Haryana youngster 16-year-old Anmol Kharb remembered to take a picture alongside a poster of London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal outside the venue. Nehwal had won the U-17 and U-19 title in the year 2003 and 2006 respectively before her breaking onto the international scene and that’s what the Faridabad youngster, who won the Naidu Hall Trophy for winning the title, wants to emulate in her career. “Saina didi remains one of the pioneers of Indian badminton at the world level and I am glad that I could win one of the tournaments, which she won as a junior player. I was not born in 2006 but seeing her picture of winning the trophy in 2006 during the whole week inspired me a lot. Hopefully, I get to play international circuit soon in my career and make a smooth transition just like she did,” says Kharb while speaking withThe Indian Express. The Haryana youngster, whose father Devender Singh works as an advocate in Faridabad, had started playing badminton on seeing her elder brother Hardik play the sport. But her brother’s decision to concentrate more on his studies meant that the youngster had to go it alone after taking up the sport seriously. Initially, the Haryana youngster would play at the Dayanand Public School in Faridabad before she started training at the Sunrise Shuttlers Academy in Noida. “My elder brother would often take me to the badminton court and I took up the game as fun. Only when he told my parents that he wants to pursue engineering, I started taking interest in badminton. When I shifted my training base to Noida, it also meant my mother Rajbala Kharb would accompany me the whole day and wait at the academy for hours while I trained. This still remains the case and when I won the title today, she was cheering for me along with my father courtside,” says Kharb. In 2019, the youngster reached the U-13 quarters in the Sub-Junior Nationals atBhagalpurwhere she lost to Unnati Hooda. Last year, Kharb reached the final of the U-17 Sub-junior Nationals at Bhubaneswar apart from a semi-final finish in the U-19 Junior Nationals at the same venue. The year also saw her winning her maiden U-17 All India Ranking title atHyderabadand a semi-final finish in the Senior All India Ranking tourney atVisakhapatnam. This year, the youngster reached the pre-quarters in the Asian Junior Championships in Indonesia apart from claiming the U-17 crown at the Sub-Junior Nationals at Hyderabad. “At the Sunrise Shuttlers Academy, I train under coach Kusam along with Indonesian coaches and the foreign coaches have put the focus on getting my racquet face fully open apart from increasing the pace on  the shuttle. It has helped me at the U-17 level. The semi-final finish in the Senior Ranking tournament made me believe that I can compete at the senior level too when I get the chance. My focus is now on the U-19 as well as the senior level in the coming years,” says the youngster. Kharb also paired up with Vennala K of Telangana to win the girls’ doubles title and the Rachel Goenka Trophy with a 17-21, 21-15, 21-11 win. “I watch videos of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty bhaiya often and it helps to create the doubles placements in my mind. I am also a fan of Tokyo Olympics champion Chen Yufei and the way she manages the court and dictates terms is my favourite,” says Kharb.',\n",
              "       'After an unprecedented Cricket World Cup, India’s Virat Kohli ends up as tragic-heroIn the midst of the silence that engulfed the arena stood Virat Kohli, his vacant stare wandering into the skies, with the forlorn look of someone betrayed. He puffed his cheeks out in anguish and ruffled his hair, in unusual disorder, with long cold fingers, as he waited impatiently for the torture of collecting the player of the tournament plank, a souvenir of pain, on the most heartbreaking of all nights. Even in the most harrowing hour, he was the centre of the crowd’s attraction. A section of teary-eyed fans chanted his name, as glances of sympathy peered from every corner of the stadium. Those would have made his pain even more intense. Hastily, coldly, he picked the piece of meaningless trophy, its value no more than that of a stone, and hurried up the long stairway to the dressing room, the trophy dangling limply at his side. There, in the anonymity of a dark corner, he could finally weep, break down and wallow in the night that was and the night that never was. The day, and the night, had the promise of a perfect ending for a near-perfect batsman in an almost-perfect World Cup. It didn’t end that way. It’s a pain only sportspersons could fully comprehend; years and months of physical labour and mental preparation blown away in one aberration of a night. All the success of past crumbling in one night. The sun indeed would rise the next day, asRahul Dravidsaid in the press conference, gleaning from his own vast experience of heartbreaks, but the darkness will linger, the bitterness would cling on, the scar shall remain unhealed. The athlete in them would move on; perhaps not the human inside them. The defeat would haunt the 14 colleagues of his, the support staff and a one billion-plus population, but it would torment Kohli even more. For he was his country’s driving force, hope and dream. There were others around him too, but he was the central piece, the golden boy, on whom everything converged, the assurance behindRohit Sharma’s aggression, the stability behindShreyas Iyer’s enterprise, the groundswell of the crowd’s optimism. En route the final, Kohli scored three hundreds, each revealing a distinct quality of his, he equalled and went pastSachin Tendulkar’s record of most hundreds in the format, becoming the greatest ODI batsman ever. He collected 765 runs at 95, no batsman has ever scored as many in this tournament. Every knock of his was an expression of joy, an attestation of his frictionless greatness. But one bad night rendered it imperfect, turning the most memorable tournament into the most disappointing one. The disbelief when Kohli edged an innocuous Pat Cummins to the stumps conveyed his frustration. It was the day he badly wanted to make his own, yet it was not his. He batted perfectly for his 54, until that moment of indiscretion. If he were selfish, he would bask in the afterglow of his personal success. But he is not. Kohli is driven not by numbers or personal glory — these are just incidental achievements to the larger cause of winning accolades for his country. Kohli knows the taste of winning a World Cup. He was only 23, and just three years into international cricket, when he carried Sachin Tendulkar on his shoulders on a victory lap at the Wankhede after winning the 2011 World Cup. He was just a chubby-faced batting tyro, yet to shed his love of chhole bhature and butter chicken, yet to embark on his rigorous physique-chiselling regimen, yet to be among the Fab Four of the world, yet to be King Kohli. Between then and now, Kohli has swished past several milestones, conquered every country he has toured, subdued the demons that had besotted him from time to tine, led his country to historic series wins, became India’s most successful captain in the longest format, developed different layers to his game, added and subtracted shots from his repertoire. Yet, he would feel lost and abandoned after theAhmedabadnight of pain. The wait for ICC silverware after the 2013 Champions Trophy would tease and torment like an impish demon. In each of the white-ball tournaments since, Kohli weaved personal success. Twice they lost the semifinals of the 50-over World Cup, once each in the final of that tournament and the Champions Trophy. Twice in three T20 World Cups were India among the semifinalists after losing the 2014 final. The pangs of knockouts just keep piling on. Even if Kohli had collected winners’ medals in all these tournaments, the latest misery would have still crushed him. A supremely-driven and proud athlete that he is, every tournament that he had not won would remain a fresh scar. In the end, the missing blanks in the ICC tournament column would not diminish the batsman he is and the leader he was. He would not be consigned to one hundred years of solitude for this. Nonetheless, he himself would feel a sense of imperfection. Like it was for Sachin Tendulkar until he finally laid his hands on a World Cup three weeks before he turned 37. Kohli is two years younger now. But he would be 39 when the next World Cup winks in. His moment might have passed, or not passed. But it is hard to think that he would fizzle out into the twilight of his career. Rather, he would burn brightly for the redemption that could furnish his career with a perfect ending. His fitness and motivation would not be a concern, perhaps his reflexes would. Kohli would, if asked, dwell on taking it year by year, series by series, producing cliches like ‘four years is too far away.’ Whatever be the narrative that is yet to unfold, 2023 was Kohli’s World Cup, one wherein he was both the hero and the tragic-hero.',\n",
              "       'Ricky Ponting lauds Pat Cummins’ faultless captaincy, pinpoints ‘gutsy move’ that swayed World Cup final vs IndiaAfter Australia defeated overwhelming favourites India by six wickets in the Cricket World Cup final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting heaped praise on Pat Cummins for his “faultless captaincy” and picked out a “gutsy move” that influenced the final. Cummins won the toss atAhmedabad, and to everyone surprise, asked Indian to bat first. Even Indian skipperRohit Sharmaadmitted that he would have batted first had he won the toss. That moment proved pivotal, as the Indian team faced a rare batting slump and could only post a total of 240 runs. The five-time champions chased down the total with six wickets in hand, thanks to Travis Head scoring 137. When Ponting was asked about Cummins’ captaincy after the finale, he first dismissed the questions that have persisted over Cummins’ leadership. “I don’t know where the negativity’s come from because there’s been no real basis for it. You look at their overall Test record since he’s been captain, it is outstanding. And now he’s a World Cup-winning captain, a World Test Championship-winning captain and a captain who retained the Ashes, so that negativity needs to be put aside now. “I think that’s (his captaincy) been almost faultless, to be honest. “I thought his leadership actually has got better and better right through the tournament,” he said onSky Sportson Sunday Then he pinpointed a gutsy call Cummins had made. “Any captain deciding to bowl first at the toss, that’s a gutsy, courageous move. Australia felt that if they could bowl well on that dry wicket early on and restrict India, batting was gonna get easier in the second innings – but we all know if you get that call wrong and you lose the game, that’s a huge decision to make for a relatively young captain,” said Ponting who led Australia to World Cup triumphs in 2003 and 2007.',\n",
              "       'As Cong Dalit ministers demand SC internal quotas, Karnataka wants Centre to take the callThe Karnataka Congress government appears to have decided to put the ball in the Centre’s court over the implementation of the 2012 report of the Justice A J Sadashiva Commission. Dalit leaders in the state Congress have been demanding that the government accept the report and provide “internal quotas” to Dalits. The Commission had been set up by a Congress-Janata Dal(Secular) government in 2005, to look into the need for classifying Karnataka’s Scheduled Castes into sub categories for the purposes of reservations, and to find ways of doing it. According to sources, the government has taken this position because the report had already been “partially accepted” by the previousBJPgovernment. “The Justice Sadashiva Commission report is not up for consideration. The previous government had accepted parts of it and had already written to the Centre to clear a path for the implementation of internal quotas. The issue is now before the Centre,” said officials in the state Law Ministry. There is fresh urgency after November 11, when Prime MinisterNarendra Moditold a poll rally in neighbouring Telangana that he would constitute a committee to look into the demand for internal reservations for Dalits, made by the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS) in that state. Soon after, three Dalit Karnataka ministers — Home Minister G Parameshwara, Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa and Food and Civil Supplies Minister K H Muniyappa — along with seven-time CongressLok SabhaMP K H Muniyappa, requested Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to accept the report. In fact, Muniyappa, who belongs to the Madiga community — considered the most deprived among Dalits — has given a call to all Madigas to stage statewide protests demanding the implementation of the report. Two weeks ago, he had asked the community to stick to their demand for the implementation of the report in the state. The Madigas are the largest block of Dalits. They feel aggrieved by better-off sub-groups hogging most of the Dalit quotas, and consider the Sadashiva report to be key to the delivery of social justice, because it studied the socio-economic conditions of Dalits as sub groups. “In our SC/ST convention before the state polls, we adopted a declaration, one of whose points was the promise to table the Sadashiva Commission report in the first Assembly session itself,” said Home Minister G Parameshwara, who belongs to a smaller but better-off sub-group of Dalits called Holeyas. Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa, who is also a Holeya, however, believes the Sadashiva report needs to be considered, but only within the framework of the Constitution, and through consultations with the Law Department. Law department officials, however, are of the view that the implementation of the report is now the prerogative of the Centre, since the previous outgoing BJP government had partially accepted it and recommended internal quotas through a Cabinet sub-committee that studied the report. “The Justice Sadashiva Commission report was accepted by the previous BJP government and placed before a Cabinet sub-committee headed by the then law minister. After the sub-committee modified the recommendations, they were accepted by the government,” said sources in the state law department. The Sadashiva Commission findings Among the essential findings of the Sadashiva Commission, which were publicised through a press release in 2012, is that Madigas (SC Left), who are considered untouchable in the caste hierarchy, are more socially backward than the ‘SC Right’ groups like Holeyas, who are considered more acceptable in society. The commission also found that most of the existing 15% quota for 101 Dalit sub-groups was being cornered by the SC Right groups like Holeyas and new SC groups like the Bhovis and the Lambanis, while the most backward Madigas continued to be deprived. The report also indicated that while Holeyas and Madigas made up nearly a third each of the SC population in Karnataka, the Madiga numbers were about 2% higher than that of the Holeyas. The BJP had promised to implement internal reservations before the 2018 Assembly polls. In power, however, the BJP government then led by CM Basavaraj Bommai rejected the Justice Sadashiva Commission report, but said it could implement some recommendations made by the Cabinet sub-committee set up to study the report. The government ended up allotting 6% quotas to the SC Left (including Madigas, as suggested by the report), 5.5% to the SC Right (Holeyas), 4.5% to the touchables (Bhovis and Lambanis), and 1% to other Dalits. Before accepting the recommendations of the sub-committee, the Bommai government increased the overall quota for SCs in the state from 15% to 17%. Since this raised the combined SC-ST quota by 6% — taking total reservations in the state to 56% (OBCs 32%, SCs 17%, STs 7%), ie., above the 50% ceiling fixed by the SC in the 1992 Indira Sawhney judgment — the Bommai government asked the Centre to incorporate the changes into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, to prevent these from being overturned by courts. The poll boomerang Eventually, the Karnataka BJP’s move to hike the reservation quota of SCs and STs before the Assembly elections in May had not paid off. While the party failed to secure a single ST-reserved seat — it had won seven last time — its tally of SC-reserved seats dropped from 16 in 2018 to 12. In contrast, the Congress won 21 of the 36 SC-reserved seats (up from 12 in 2018) and swept the ST seats by winning 14 out of 15 (up from 7 in 2018), with one going to the JD(S).',\n",
              "       'Decoding Politics: Why is BJP raising two ‘comments’, one by Gehlot loyalist, another by his son?Poll-bound Rajasthan’s political discourse seems to be revolving around two key issues. Firstly, a comment by state Cabinet minister and Ashok Gehlot loyalist Shanti Dhariwal, which allegedly insulted the women of the state. Another issue that has grabbed the limelight is an alleged remark by Chief Minister Gehlot’s son Vaibhav, that the Congress government led by his father will not come back to power. So, how have the two issues become a frequent feature of the political discourse in Rajasthan? Dhariwal’s statement and the subsequent row On March 9 last year, a day after International Women’s Day, Dhariwal during an address in the Assembly said the high number of rapes in Rajasthan were due to it ‘‘being a men’s state’’. Replying during a debate on grants to the police and jails of the state, Dhariwal, who is also the Minister for Law and Legal Affairs, said, “We are number one in rape. Isme koi do raai nahi. Ab ye rape ke mamle mein kyu hai, kahin na kahin galti hai ye toh s**** (Why we are number one in rapes, there is a fault somewhere).” As a few MLAs behind him began speaking, Dhariwal turned around and said, “Rajasthan toh mardon ka pradesh raha hai. Ab uska kya kare? (Rajasthan has been a state of men. What can be done?)” The MLAs then burst into laughter. However, no protests were held in the Assembly over the remarks as the OppositionBJPhad staged a walkout before the minister’s address. However, later in the day, BJP state president Satish Poonia slammed Dhariwal’s comments and termed his “shameless confession of the state being number one in rapes” an insult to the women. “The remarks have also lowered the dignity of men. If the Congress has any morality left, such a minister should be sacked,” he had said. The National Commission for Women (NCW) had also taken suo moto cognizance of Dhariwal’s comments while the BJP created an uproar over them in the Assembly the following day. Dhariwal subsequently apologised and said his remarks were the result of a “slip of tongue”. The minister’s candidature for the polls hung in the balance with the Congress high command reportedly against it for his role in organising a separate meeting of MLAs loyal to Gehlot while skipping an official Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting last year. Eventually, he was fielded by the party from Kota North, which he represents in the current Assembly. The BJP has now dug up the year-old issue to slam the Congress. At a rally in Bharatpur last week, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiattacked Dhariwal without naming him. “The Congress has rewarded this minister with a ticket instead of punishing him. Even people inDelhi(Congress high command) agreed to give him a ticket. This raises a question of what “second red diary” is in the possession of jaadugar’s (Gehlot) favourite minister that even Delhi had to bow down to him. Every Congress leader knows the minister’s truth, yet they gave him a ticket as he has information about people in Delhi. After the BJP forms the government here, I promise to unravel that secret too,” Modi had said. This brings us to the question of what the “first red diary” is. The first red diary and Vaibhav’s statement The “red diary” first hogged the limelight in July after former minister of state Rajendra Singh Gudha claimed he was sent by the CM to retrieve the diary from the house of Gehlot’s close aideDharmendraRathore, whose house was being raided by central agencies amid a political crisis in 2020. Gudha’s claims came after he was sacked as minister by Gehlot, hours after he had slammed the state government in the House over the rise in crimes against women. The former MoS had urged his government to introspect on this, rather than speak on the violence in Manipur. Since his unceremonious exit, Gudha has been raking up the red diary while claiming that the CM has been regularly asking him whether he had burnt it. The former minister also claimed that Gehlot would be behind bars had he not retrieved the diary. Gudha has now joined theShiv Sena(Eknath Shinde) and will be in the fray from Udaipurwati constituency, which he won in 2018 as a BSP candidate. Last week too, the Udaipurwati MLA raked up the issue when he showed some pages of the purported diary to the media. “Vaibhav Gehlot says this government will not come back to power. I can give it in writing that my father cannot come back to power. Rajendra Gudha is not saying this. This is being said by Vaibhav Gehlot, the chief minister’s son,” the Udaipurwati MLA said while flaunting pages of the “red diary”, though there is no confirmation of Vaibhav having said this. The BJP and Modi have targeted Gehlot over the diary. “Some people say that there is a quboolnama (confession) of a son in the red diary, where he says his papa’s government will not come back to power,” Modi said at a recent rally. Modi raked up the issue again at a public meeting in Nagaur. “Gehlot ji, kya ho gaya? Aapka jaadu aapke bete par bhi nahi chal raha hai kya (What happened Gehlotji? Is your magic not working on your own son)?” he had said.',\n",
              "       'Rajasthan polls | ‘Will teach Congress a lesson’: The Sachin Pilot impasse may cost party in Gujjar beltTHE CONGRESS has survived a narrow win, one mutiny and one quieter rebellion in the last five years to stay in power in Rajasthan – all the while dogged by the Sachin Pilot question. Now, the BJP is cashing in. In 2018, the Gujjar community had rallied behind Pilot, electing 8 Gujjar MLAs from the Congress and none from theBJP. The BJP and Congress are matched in tickets to Gujjar candidates this time – 10 and 11, respectively – and the BJP is banking on the community favouring it, especially in eastern Rajasthan, where Pilot’s influence goes well beyond the Gujjar community. The BJP has been working on the plan for long. This January, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiaddressed a programme to commemorate the 1,111th ‘Avataran Mahotsav’ of Gujjar deity Devnarayan in Bhilwara. Former BJP chief ministerVasundhara Rajewas not present. It was under her term that over 70 Gujjars were killed during a violent reservation agitation. “The party has been trying to approach the community with a clean slate, and it will show in the results,” a BJP leader says. The ‘betrayal’ The BJP’s confidence is reflected on the ground. In Mitrpura in Dausa district – Pilot used to be an MP from this Gujjar-dominated seat, as were his parents Rajesh and Rama – three men of a Gujjar family slam the Congress’s “beizzati (insult)” of Pilot, after the 2018 party win was attributed to a large extent to his efforts as party president. Sumer Singh Gurjar, 52, says: “We voted for the Congress withtann, mann, dhan(wholeheartedly).Par daga kar diya Pilot ke saath(But they cheated Pilot).” The support for Pilot had also carried several Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste candidates of the Congress past the winning mark in 2018, despite the Meenas (who are STs) and Gujjars being considered traditional caste rivals. Sumer says the community continues to back Gajraj Khatana and Murari Lal Meena, but there are doubts over Gujjar support for Congress sitting ministers Parsadi Lal Meena, Mamta Bhupesh (SC) and MLA O P Hudla (ST), among others. The Gujjar-Meena bonhomie, or what’s left of it, was further strained by Parsadi Lal’s remark recently, saying: “Sachin Pilot, Rajesh Pilotko humne he panpaya hai(have thrived due to us). No one knew them before 1984. I was the lone Meena leader who was with them and supported whoever the party asked us to – be it Sachin, Rajesh or Rama Pilot.” In September, Congress MLA from Sawai Madhopur and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s adviser Danish Abrar faced the brunt of the anger over the Pilot issue in his own constituency. Considered a Pilot loyalist, he had sided with Gehlot during Pilot’s 2020 rebellion, when the then deputy CM and 18 other MLAs had parked themselves in hotels in BJP-ruled Haryana, ultimately failing to get enough numbers to break away. Visiting Sawai Madhopur for a programme to honour Gujjar deity Devnarayan, Abrar had been met with slogans of “Pilot ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro s*****n ko(Shoot those who betrayed Pilot).” The same month, a vehicle in which Niwai MLA Prashant Bairwa was travelling came under attack. Like Abrar, Bairwa too was considered close to Pilot but did not join him in the rebellion. In Dausa’s Kherli village, father-son duo Nihal Singh Gurjar and Ajay Singh, 26, say the Congress would have benefited had it implemented a formula of 2.5-years each for Gehlot and Pilot as CM. The high command’s efforts in this regard were constantly thwarted by Gehlot. Last year, Gehlot loyalists even stayed out of a CLP meeting which was understood to have been called byDelhito pick Pilot as CM. Nihal says they won’t vote for Bhupesh this time even if Pilot himself canvasses for the minister. The unhappiness with Minister Bhupesh, the MLA from Sikrai, is only partly it; Nihal wants to teach the Congress a “lesson” for Pilot being openly called “naakara nikamma”, as Gehlot has done more than once. There is another factor behind the winds of change in the Gujjar belt. The son of Gujjar reservation agitation architect Kirori Singh Bainsla, Vijay Bainsla, is a BJP candidate from Deoli Uniara Assembly seat, part of Tonk district adjoining Dausa. Tonk’s Muslim ‘anger’ In Tonk, Pilot’s own Assembly constituency – where they are the largest group among 2.5 lakh voters – the Muslims are also angry with the Congress government, their despair arising from its “silence” on issues affecting the community. However, they are largely forgiving of Pilot. This August, during a visit to Tonk, Pilot was accosted by Mohsin Rasheed, the Rajasthan coordinator of the Congress minority cell, who asked why he hadn’t spoken up on the Nasir-Junaid case, referring to the killing of two Muslim youths by “cow vigilantes”. He also questioned Pilot over the Congress favouring approaching the Supreme Court against the High Court’s acquittal of the Jaipur bomb blast accused, the suggestion being that they were not innocent. Pilot admonished him for “spreadinggalatfehmi(falsehoods)”. When the elections came around, Rasheed, 42, who has a significant following on social media, threw his hat into the ring. He later withdrew, on the counsel of “the community’s elders” and after assurances by the Pilot camp, he says. Rasheed still talks about Pilot’s muted response on issues affecting the community, including a recent statement by BJP Tonk district in-charge and controversial leader Ramesh Bidhuri that “Lahore is watching the Tonk polls”. However, out in the streets of Tonk, the general – and generous – view is that Pilot can’t afford to take a pro-Muslim stand and turn Hindus away. “Bidhuri has been sent to provoke tensions and if Pilot speaks, he might lose their (Hindu) votes,” says Anwar, 32, who runs a recycling shop in Tonk’s Kafila market, while adding that vote for Pilot is their “majboori (helplessness)”. Among a group at a tea-stall nearby, Arif, 45, says Muslims have no option other than the Congress. “Where else will we go?” After Muslims, the biggest chunk of voters in Tonk are SCs, followed by Gujjars, and then Jats, STs and upper castes. While Pilot’s candidature makes it a safe seat for the Congress now, it has voted almost equally for the party and BJP since the BJP was formed in 1980 – with the BJP winning in 1980, 1990, 1993, 2003 and 2013; and the Congress in 1985, 1998, 2008 and 2018. Last time, Pilot won by over 54,000 votes against the BJP’s Yunus Khan, an influential leader displaced from his traditional bastion. While Pilot is expected to win again, if not as comfortably, even staunch Gujjar supporters believe the government may be changing in Jaipur. One of them, Ram Gurjar, says the Congress should make amends and name Pilot as at least the Leader of the Opposition or the party state president, if the BJP wins. BJP candidate Ajit Singh Mehta, who won from Tonk in 2013, calls Pilot “an outsider”, who has “undone all the work done during my tenure”. “Pilot doesn’t know which village has water or electricity issues, or about the missing compounders and doctors at PHCs and CHCs.” He talks of pulling off an upset like senior BJP leader Smriti Irani did in Amethi, defeatingRahul Gandhifrom the family bastion in 2019. “Today, kings are not born in wombs… it is the people who decide,” Mehta says. “Pilot was the CM face in 2018, but this time the CM (Gehlot) has said the chair won’t leave him. So Pilot is contesting an MLA election, and so am I.” And then he brings up that ‘R’ word, saying people remember that Pilot is a leader who rebelled against his party. Back in Kafila, at another tea-stall, Abdul Raees, 63, says: “No party really helps us, but we want the Congress to come to power… We just want to live peacefully, that’s the only issue for us in Tonk.”',\n",
              "       'Today in Politics: PM Modi to chair virtual G20  summit; Amit Shah steps up Rajasthan campaignPrime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a virtual summit of G20 leaders on Wednesday evening, to discuss the implementation of the Delhi Declaration adopted in September and several new challenges that have emerged since then. Addressing a press conference inDelhion the eve of the summit, India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant said the deliberations will witness “excellent participation” from leaders of the grouping. China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin had skipped the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10. However, the Russian Tass news agency, quoting a Kremlin statement, has confirmed that Putin will take part in the extraordinary virtual G20 summit on Wednesday, adding that the Russian President had to miss the Delhi summit in September and the Bali summit in November, 2022, as he had to focus on the “special military operation” inUkraine. Kant described the virtual summit as “rare and exceptional” which would give Modi an opportunity to interact with the world leaders for a second time during India’s G20 Presidency before it passes on to Brazil in December. The virtual meeting of G20 leaders is taking place a day after leaders of the BRICS grouping held an extraordinary meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. On the domestic politics front, with just two days left for campaigning for the November 25 Rajasthan Assembly elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah will continue his campaigning in the state on Wednesday, addressing rallies in Pali, Jalore and Sanchore districts.

Announcing theSamajwadi Party(SP)’s programme to pay tributes to the party’s founder, lateMulayam SinghYadav, on his birth anniversary Wednesday, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said that after the 2024Lok Sabhapolls, there will be a “big change” in the country and samajwadis will play an important role in it. “After 2024, there will be a different kind of a change in the country, and samajwadis will play an important role in it. The SP’s PDAYatrahas sent a strong message. The PDA will compete with the BJP and the NDA,” Akhilesh said, during his Picchde, Dalit, Alpsankhyak (Backward, Dalit and Minority) rally inLucknow. “Seeing the strength of the PDA, many parties are now supporting caste census. Even parties which had earlier stopped this, have now come in favour of caste census,” he said. The SP president said the caste census has been a longstanding demand for his party because it is crucial for social justice. “The first thing SP will do after coming to power is to conduct a caste census,” he added. InMumbai,Shiv Sena(UBT) MLC Anil Parab said the cross-examination of Shiv Sena (UBT) chief whip Sunil Prabhu, which began on Tuesday, will continue on Wednesday. Prabhu is being cross-examined by lawyers of the Shiv Sena (Shinde) in the case related to the disqualification of MLAs of the undivided Shiv Sena. “Cross examination of Sunil Prabhu took place today. He gave appropriate answers to all the questions,” Parab said, adding that Prabhu had demanded that his statement be recorded in Marathi, and sought an official translator who could record it, after alleging that it was not being done correctly. “We felt that many questions were not needed and there was a delaying tactic. They have to give judgment by December 31. There is a possibility that they could seek further time and we don’t want to give that,” Parab added. On September 18, the Supreme Court had directed Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to give the judgment on disqualification of rebel Sena MLAs by December 31, coming down hard on him over the delay in deciding the disqualification pleas filed by both Sena factions against each other. In Kerala, the LDF government’s outreach programme, “Nava Kerala Sadas”, will continue through Kannur district on Wednesday, when CM Pinarayi Vijayan will chair a Cabinet meeting at Thalassery. On Tuesday, Vijayan claimed the workers of the CPI(M) youth wing DYFI had saved the lives of some Youth Congress (YC) activists who had allegedly tried to jump in front of the CM’s cavalcade, waving black flags. He added that they had not been assaulted, as reported. The Congress contested the CM’s statement, claiming that the CPI(M) and DYFI workers had carried out brutal violence against Congress student wing Kerala Students Union (KSU) and YC activists. Earlier in the day, Vijayan, at a press briefing in Kannur, had said he was sitting in the front seat of the bus on which he and his Cabinet colleagues were travelling as part of the sadas, and saw the YC activists trying to jump in front of the vehicle. “It happened right in front of my eyes. The DYFI workers were trying to prevent them from jumping in front of the oncoming vehicle. They were saving the lives of the YC activists, for which some force had to be used. It was not an assault,” the CM said. – With PTI inputs',\n",
              "       'Ex-CJ defends rap on EC: if it’s seen tilting, it matters in a democracyAcknowledging the need for judicial restraint, Justice Sanjib Banerjee underlined that the Election Commission’s conduct can have “great consequences” for democracy as he defended his 2021 observations, as former Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, that “murder charges” should be imposed on the poll panel for violating Covid protocols during Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. “A judge should certainly be restrained. However, the Election Commission is an institution which has a great responsibility. So, if it is seen tilting, one way or the other, by even a very small degree, it can have great consequences for democracy,” he toldThe Indian Expressdays after he retired as Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court. After an 11-month stint as Chief Justice of Madras High Court, Justice Banerjee was transferred as Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court. He retired on November 1. “The case was being heard (in Madras HC) for a while and I felt there were some aberrations which is why those observations were made. Crowding in rallies and not following Covid protocol was certainly a concern and when the elections in West Bengal was held an eight phases, why was it held in a single phase in Tamil Nadu? You have to look\\xa0 at it in that context and not pick just two sentences,” Justice Banerjee said. “Also, one cannot say that the court can’t make any observations. Lawyers cannot be expected to argue with a wall. They have to get indications from the bench so they can tailor their case accordingly,” he said. The EC had moved the Supreme Court against these observations, terming them “uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory.” While the SC refused to expunge the observation or bar the media from reporting it, Justice Banerjee‘s observations were widely discussed in legal circles when he was suddenly transferred to Meghalaya, one of the smallest High Courts. When asked if he knew the reasons behind his unusual transfer, Justice Banerjee said that he is not concerned with the reason. “I am sure there were cogent reasons for my transfer but I am not aware of it. I received an email (from then CJI NV Ramana’s office) and I said yes. Once you become a judge, you cannot have any ambitions of holding a particular office. So there was no question of me not consenting to the transfer,” he said. A statement published by the Collegium on November 9, 2021 said that “the Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on 16th September, 2021, has recommended the transfer of Mr Justice, Sanjiv, Banerji, Chief Justice, Madras High Court to Meghalaya High Court.” While the statement cited no reason, Justice Banerjee said that the email only indicated that the transfer would be in the “interest of better administration of justice.” Justice Banerjee added: “But I would not have had it any other way. The work that happened in Meghalaya during my stint was very important. In my 11 months in Madras, I had very rewarding judicial work. But in Meghalaya, there wasn’t a lot of judicial work but we focused on infrastructure building.” On his stint in Madras, Justice Banerjee said that he was far from wanting to maintain the status quo and actively handled things in Madras High Court. “While the idea is that a Chief Justice who comes from outside takes a dispassionate view when it comes to appointments or other aspects, there is a flip side that they could end up being status quo-ists without wanting to ruffle too many feathers. By and large, the office of Chief Justice is considered a stepping stone for Supreme Court judgeship. It is to be somewhere but look elsewhere and not take steps to actively address the uncle judge syndrome when it comes to appointments,” he said. As a High Court judge for nearly two decades, he said, corruption in the higher judiciary worries him. “Punitive transfers are not enough. Corruption is an unimpeachable offence but it is difficult to gather evidence. These activities are not done in broad daylight but it is possible to collect some evidence of corruption. However, impeachment is a political solution. A compromised judge is convenient for all political parties. This is an aspect which erodes faith in the system and needs to be tackled,” he said.',\n",

TheBJPreacted sharply, accusing Gandhi of using abusive language against the Prime Minister because of the frustration of electoral losses. “Panauti… panauti… Achha bhalaa hamare ladke wahaan World Cup jeetne waale the, par panauti harwaa diya. TV waale ye nahin kahenge magar janta jaanti hai(Our boys were going to win the World Cup, but panauti got them defeated. TV channels will not say this but the public knows),” Gandhi said at a public rally in Balotra, Rajasthan. Rajasthan goes to polls on November 25. Just a week ago, Modi had called Rahulmoorkhon ka sardaar(leader of fools) after Rahul said everybody in India has only Chinese mobile handsets. “Congress leaders suffer a mental disease of not acknowledging India’s achievements,” Modi had said in Madhya Pradesh, and said India had taken rapid strides in mobile manufacturing. Earlier this year,Rahul Gandhiwas briefly disqualified as a Member of Parliament after aSuratcourt handed him a two-year sentence for his remark on the surname Modi. He was reinstated only after the Supreme Court stayed the sentence. Demanding an apology from Gandhi for his latest remark, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “What has happened to you, Rahul Gandhi? You are so troubled because of the frustration of losses that you are using abusive language against the Prime Minister of the country. Our Prime Minister loves our players and goes to boost their morale and to help them. The Bharatiya team is doing well in Asiads, Olympics and paralympics. Our players played very well. It’s all right – defeat and victory happen. Rahul Gandhi must apologise.” KC Venugopal of the Congress, however, defended Gandhi’s jibe. “Rahul ji has said what many have been thinking since 2 days! The World Cup finals was a moment of pride for 140 crore Indians and we were all looking forward to this historic occasion, but they were desperate to hijack it for their political mileage. The BJP should be the last ones to talk about political correctness. These Godse bhakts, including PM Modi, who have regularly insulted Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi ji, Sonia ji and Rahul ji with the most vile abuses are finding it difficult to digest the hard truth,” Venugopal wrote on social media platform X.

He had found himself at the centre of a similar controversy last year during the Gujarat Assembly elections. “We see your (Modi’s) face in corporation elections, MLA elections or MP elections, everywhere… Do you have 100 heads like Ravan,” he said at a public meeting inAhmedabad. The BJP had then accused Kharge of likening the PM to Ravan.

              "       'From the Urdu Press: ‘Cricket World Cup sets stage for India as sports host’, ‘BJP negative politics show no plans for Telangana’Cricket and politics defined the coverage of the Urdu Press over the week as a blink of theIndian cricket team in the world cup final,following a long dream run, broke a billion hearts. The Urdu dailies vied with each other to capture all the sights and sounds of the cricketing fiesta. The dailies have kept their gaze on the game of politics too, focusing now on the campaigning of the leading players in Rajasthan and Telangana, which are up for polls in the coming few days. Roznama Rashtriya Sahara Commenting on Australia’s win over India in the final of the ICC men’s cricket world cup, the multi-edition Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, in its leader titled, “Team India: match hara, dil jeeta (Team India: match lost, hearts won)”, writes that victory and loss are part of any game, which cannot be reduced to just the bare bones of results. It would not be fair to look at the performance of any sportsperson or team through the narrow prism of the outcome, because while taking to the field no one wants to put in less than their best efforts, the editorial says. “And this is also not necessary that the team which has been performing well consistently and appears invincible will never face a setback. In the cricket World Cup, for instance, the Indian team displayed excellent performance throughout the tournament, proving itself to be the world’s best team (before it was felled by the Aussies).” The daily highlights the accomplishments ofVirat Kohli, who notched up maximum runs while also breakingSachin Tendulkar’s iconic record by scoring his 50th century, andMohammed Shami, who emerged as the highest wicket-taker. “When Australia lost three wickets for 47 runs while chasing India’s modest total of 240, it seemed the latter had an edge, but Travis Head’s stellar knock of 137 backed by Marnus Labuschagne deprived India of its third World Cup title and gave Australia its sixth World Cup trophy,” it notes. The editorial points out that this was the first time that India hosted the entire World Cup event. “This edition of the biggest cricketing tournament was a grand success. This sets the stage for India to host other major global sporting events in future, which will entail the development of new cities and promote various sports among their denizens,” it states. This would also break entrenched social stereotypes that still remain heavily tilted in favour of academic studies, the edit says. “But social trends are changing now and so are people’s priorities. Efforts are being made to popularise various sports. Indian players are earning laurels in several new sports, thereby signalling that the future is also bright for the country’s other sportspersons besides cricketers.” Urdu Times Referring to Prime MinisterNarendra Modi’s address to media persons at theBJP’s “Diwali Milan” event at the party’s headquarters inDelhi, theMumbai-based Urdu Times, in its editorial on November 18, writes that the PM expressed concern over the dangers of the deepfakes produced through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the crises they can pose. The PM cited his own example to say that he recently saw a video of him performing garba even though he has not done so since his school days, the edit states. “The PM’s statement has reignited a debate on the issue on social media.” The daily says fake news is a huge problem in a country like India, which has set off several incidents of violence and even riots in which lives have been lost. “One of the common methodologies for spreading fake news on social media is the use of a wrong video for making a false claim. Deepfake is more dangerous since it is done through AI with such skill and precision that it can barely be recognised as morphed,” it says, adding that through such a hazardous technology any picture can be superimposed on any video to hit your target. The daily notes that actress Rashmika Mandanna recently became one of its victims. The AI will make the task of distinguishing truth from falsehood more challenging, with even genuine content running the risk of being dismissed as fake now, it notes. The editorial points out that the Israel-Hamas war has spawned many videos which have polarised the world. It says many people do not have the fact-checking capabilities. In an oblique swipe at the BJP, the edit charges that its IT cell has been indulging in misinformation and that PM Modi should ask its head to curb it. “The concern flagged by PM Modi over AI-generated fake content is valid, which must be endorsed by proponents of social media.” Siasat Referring to the upcoming voting in the remaining two poll-bound states, Telangana and Rajasthan, theHyderabad-based Siasat, in its editorial on November 20, notes that the campaigning by the leading contenders has reached a crescendo there. In Telangana, besides the top brass of the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) — including Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR, his son and minister K T Rama Rao, and minister T Harish Rao — senior leaders of the Congress and the BJP have been engaged in making their final push, it says. “The Congress has promised several guarantees and welfare schemes for people and has also issued a manifesto. The BRS has also made pledges on similar lines. However, it seems the BJP has set aside its development agenda, looking to garner poll dividends only through polarisation.” The daily notes that PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have led the BJP’s campaign in Telangana. “Shah also released the BJP’s manifesto, but did not announce any development scheme or programme, raking up emotive issues instead. He promised that the party will arrange for free darshan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya if the BJP is voted to power,” it says, adding that followers of other religions are also residents of Telangana. “Besides, the BJP’s manifesto promises implementation of the Uniform Civil Code.” The editorial points out that Telangana BJP chief G Kishan Reddy has been announcing that the BJP will form a “bulldozer government” if elected. “This is unfortunate that a party like the BJP which is ruling the country is resorting to the politics of fear and polarisation, instead of projecting its achievements, to garner votes in Telangana. The BJP does not seem to have any plan or programme to offer for the development of India’s newest state,” it says, calling the party’s Telangana strategy “negative politics”. “Is Telangana not facing various problems including price rise, unemployment and lack of basic amenities?” the edit asks, adding that using a divisive plank while steering clear of such basic public issues betrays a “cynical mindset”.',\n",
              "       'Alliance talks on backburner, BJP banks on Central schemes as Akalis aim for youth in PunjabSEASONED politicians from the BJP and Akali Dal want the two long-time friends to come together again. But, for now, this seems in suspended animation. Ahead of theLok Sabhaelections, while the SAD is trying to bank on youth to revive its political fortunes, theBJPis counting on Central schemes to strike a chord in the rural belt, a segment the saffron party had once left for its former ally to take care of. On November 14, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal launched a ‘Global Youth Membership Drive’ under the aegis of the “Punjab di shaan, saade naujawan (Our youth the pride of Punjab)”. As part of the drive, the SAD aims to give 50% party posts to youth aged 35 or below at the district level, and 40 years or below at the state level, apart from giving them “appropriate” electoral representation. Youth Akali Dal president Sarabjeet Singh Jhinjer toldThe Indian Express, “Within 24 hours of the launch of our drive, as many as 12,433 people enrolled as members.” He added that by November 20, around 32,000 people had enrolled for the drive, where anyone joining the organisation needs to give details like the constituency they live in, their phone numbers and a declaration that they aren’t facing any criminal cases. Senior SAD leader and former Nakodar MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala said, “The party’s focus is now on the next generation. They exercise a huge voice in the decision-making within their respective families at the time of voting. The political spectrum is moved by the youth. So, for any party to remain relevant, focus on the youth is of utmost importance. Hence, the Akali move.” Jhinjer said the youth who are enrolling would go on to be “future MPs, MLAs and members of the SGPC and zila parishads. At least 60% of the electors are youth, and they are the future leaders”. The SAD has announced activists who enrol the highest numbers of youth will be chosen as district presidents, with 2,000 being the minimum qualifying number in a district. The BJP, on the other hand, is focusing on beneficiaries of schemes sponsored by the Centre. Confined mostly to urban areas when it was an ally of the SAD, the Punjab BJP is now focusing heavily on rural areas, including via Shakti Kendras, to create a grassroots party cadre. To begin with, the party plans to appoint an activist each to head booths, and create a team of 15-20 volunteers at the village level. The ‘Viksit Bharat SankalpYatra’, the party’s flagship initiative to highlight centrally sponsored schemes, was kicked off on Wednesday from Ropar and Mohali districts, to be followed by Amritsar on Thursday and culminating in Tarn Taran on December 4. At a press conference on Monday, Union Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce Som Prakash and Punjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar alleged that the ruling AAP “specialises in taking credit for Central schemes and projects, where it has no singular contribution”. Som Prakash said that Rs 1,563 crore for four-laning of the Phagwara-Mukerian road and Rs 411 crore for the rail link between Talwara and Mukerian, were both sanctioned by the Centre. He added, “The AAP even tried to take credit for the Guru Ravidass Auditorium, which was built during the previous SAD and Congress governments.” At a meeting chaired by state BJP organisational secretary Manthri Srinivasulu in Sunam on November 14, party leaders in the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency — held by AAP CM Bhagwant Singh Mann once — were told to reach out to the beneficiaries of the Central welfare schemes and seek their support for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Addressing a press conference on November 16, Jakhar accused the AAP government of “swindling and hijacking Central schemes for the distribution of wheat”, targeting its doorstep delivery of atta programme. He said, “Due to the AAP’s apathy, 1.41 crore beneficiaries who receive wheat under the Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana scheme launched by PM Modi will now get poor quality atta.”',\n",
              "       '‘When we contest, we fight for all. If any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction’: BJP Nathdwara candidatePitted against five-time Congress MLA and Assembly Speaker C P Joshi, BJP’s Vishwaraj Singh, a member of the Mewar royal family who claims descent from legendary Rajput warrior king Maharana Pratap, speaks about the coming polls. Excerpts: Joshi has been in politics for a long time, but over the years, he has earned a reputation which I think will work to my advantage. Also, in the same Nathdwara constituency, we have Shrinathji and Haldighati (the historical battlefield where Maharana Pratap fought Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576). There is a strong bond (between the royal family and the people). This sentiment brings about a feeling of trust, which is often lacking in politics. So yes… The question implies that lineage does not guarantee a good performance. I strongly disagree with this. I understand that the people wanted me and hence the party chose me. I am not making any personal comments against the Congress candidate. It is the general impression about the Congress here. I bring to the table what theBJPhas achieved and what it hopes to in the future. Some of the key issues where I will put in my sincere efforts are increasing payments to farmers and to curb the rising price of petrol, which is the most expensive in the state. I disagree that the Congress has rolled out welfare policies. For four-and-a-half years, they have been squabbling over who is going to be chief minister. Announcements made over the past few months have been done keeping the upcoming elections in mind. Administratively, I do not think any of these decisions were wise. On the one hand, they are decreasing the price of LPG cylinders, but are hiking petrol prices. This is like taking money from the right pocket and keeping it in the left. I don’t want to comment on whether the incident is being used to polarise voters on communal lines. When we contest elections, we fight for all communities. If there has been any polarisation, it may be an organic reaction to the incident and not the result of someone’s deliberate attempt. Also, there is no accountability regarding crimes against women in the state. The government relief in the Kanhaiya Lal case came very late and was not equal to what was given in Jaipur (in case of another killing). I don’t think things are being handled in a fair manner. I see no reason in publicising what I do in my personal life. When it comes to politics, it is about doing something constructive and for people’s benefit. There is an appropriate time for everything. This was the time when I got an opportunity and I thought it would be correct of me to take it up.',\n",
              "       'Cong veteran C P Joshi feels the heat as Maharana Pratap descendant enters the battlefieldThe old haveli at Dabiyon ka Guda, a small village about 15 km from Nathdwara in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan, is bustling with activity. Women in colourful, traditional Rajasthani attires mill around in the courtyard while turbaned men wait outside in anticipation of “Mewarnath” Vishwaraj Singh, who claims descent from legendary warrior king Maharana Pratap and theBJP’s candidate for the upcoming Assembly elections. With Singh in the fray, Nathdwara’s election has turned into a “clash of titans” as he is up against Assembly Speaker and veteran Congress leader C P Joshi. Despite the “crown prince” arriving an hour late for his rally, people welcome him with drumbeats and shower petals on him even as youth among the crowd break into slogans of “Maharana Pratap ki jai”. Women greet him with aarti before he enters the haveli and pays obeisance to the deity in the temple inside. Singh then takes a seat on the platform outside as people, whose names are announced along with their clan, come forward to garland him and touch his feet as a mark of respect. On the personal front, a soft-spoken Singh exhibits humility but the underscoring of Mewari traditions in his campaign is unmistakable. In his address, apart from attacking the Congress on its “misgovernance”, the BJP candidate emphasises to the people that his relationship with them is 1,400 years old and stresses on how people across community lines fought together under Maharana Pratap. Local leaders at the Congress’s campaign office in Nathdwara say Joshi is going village to village to highlight the developmental work that he has undertaken in the constituency. “The BJP has nothing to show for ground work. They are playing the sentiment card and hence their campaign revolves around the Mewar king and Shri Ram,” a Congress leader says. Going into the election, the Congress will also have Joshi’s electoral past in mind. The Assembly Speaker, who has won from Nathdwara five times since 1985, led the party to victory as state president in 2008 but lost his seat by a single vote to the BJP’s Kalyan Singh Chauhan. It is widely believed that Joshi’s aspirations of becoming CM vanished with the defeat. A key factor that is likely to influence the electoral outcome in Nathdwara is the caste composition of the electorate. Rajputs alone make up 30% of the voters while Brahmins are 15%. The BJP, by fielding the Mewar royal, is hoping that the Rajput pride translates into votes in its favour. The preference of candidates based on caste seems to be evident on the ground too. While conceding that Joshi, a Brahmin, has done a lot of work in the constituency, Mahipal Singh, a Rajput, throws his weight behind Vishwaraj Singh. “Nathdwara is more developed than the district headquarters, Rajsamand. Joshi, a tall leader, made the government focus on the constituency. But now Raja (Vishwaraj Singh) is here and the sentiment of the people is attached to him. Joshiji would have won hands down if Vishwaraj Singh was not in the picture. Who knows Raja may settle down here if he wins?” Mahipal Singh says. Many other voters of the Rajput community echo the shopkeeper’s views. A section of Brahmin voters too appear eager to throw their weight behind Vishwaraj Singh. Home guard Manoj Paliwal says people will go with the royal as they hold him in high regard, despite Joshi’s contributions. The pro-royal sentiment, however, wanes among OBCs and tribals, who also make up a significant chunk – around 40% – of the electorate. In Siswi ki Dandi village, where Vishwaraj Singh addresses a gathering of Rehbaris and Salvis – both OBCs – the crowd accords him a grand welcome, but begins speaking of Joshi’s good work moments after he leaves. “Do not go by the way we welcomed him. We are a village of camel herders and have a long association with the royal family. We revere them. The family has historically suffered a lot to keep Islamic rulers at bay,” says Tulsi Ram, who belongs to the Rehbari community, adding: “But we cannot forget the work Joshiji has done for us.” In Semal village, close to the legendary battlefield of Haldighati, where Maharana Pratap faced off against Mughal emperor Akbar in 1576, Kamal Sain says the lingering question is whether Vishwaraj Singh will be available when the people need him. “No one knows the Maharaja. Will he meet us and get our work done? A few years ago, when we needed a school in the village, we asked Joshi, who got orders passed for the school in a day,” Sain, who belongs to the Nai (OBC) community, says. In tribal-dominated Udan village near Nathdwara town, Bhimrai says he doesn’t know the government but is aware of Joshi. Bhimrai, who belongs to the Bhil community, says he will vote for the veteran Congress leader. Joshi, however, is feeling the heat from the BJP. A look at the list of public events to be attended by the BJP and Congress candidates on Monday tells a story. While Vishwaraj Singh was slated to visit 13 places, Joshi was slated to visit 39.',\n",
              "       '‘Redemption’ for BJP leader whose case led to Rahul Gandhi conviction, Purnesh Modi gets charge of UTPurnesh Modi’s appointment as the BJP’s incharge for the Union Territory of Daman, Diu, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli followshis criminal defamation suit against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently led to his conviction and brief disqualification as a Lok Sabha MP. Given that Purnesh had been unceremoniously shunned out of his ministry months ahead of the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections, the appointment is also being perceived as “redemption” for the leader, if not a “reward” for the case he won against Rahul. Purnesh will hold the post of UT in-charge for three years, and said his primary focus will be to ensure the party’s victory in the upcomingLok Sabhaelections. “I will work with local teams and strengthen the party at the grassroots level (booth level) to ensure electoral benefits for theBJP. We believe power can be attained through a strong organisation. My focus will lie on booth-level political and micro management,” he said. The Dadra & Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat is currently held by Kalaben Delkar, the widow of former seven-time MP Mohan Delkar, who died of suspected suicide in aMumbaihotel in 2021. Delkar, an influential tribal leader, had won the seat as an Independent in 2019, but had later moved to the JD(U). His wife was elected as MP in November 2021 on aShiv Senaticket. The other Lok Sabha seat in the UT is held by the BJP’s Lalu Patel. Delkar’s death had led to consternation in the BJP ranks as the Daman, Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli UT administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, was among the nine people named in the abetment to suicide case. The Bombay High Court had later quashed the case. Khoda Patel was also given additional charge as the Administrator of Lakshadweep. BJP leaders believe that Purnesh’s Gujarati roots will help the party in the two Lok Sabha constituencies, which are geographically connected to Gujarat, especially in the Delkar stronghold of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. “His appointment has spread a positive wave among party leaders and workers. This is the first time that a Gujarati has been appointed as incharge. Local leaders and workers were less interested in working with former incharges like Vinod Sonkar and Vidhya Rahatkar,” senior BJP leader Dipak Jadhav, who has been associated with the party in the region for 33 years, said. An OBC leader, Purnesh was minister for roads in the previous Bhupendra Patel Cabinet before he was stripped of his berth in August 2022. He has been an active member of the BJP inSuratfor over two decades, and he has impressed with his organisational skills as BJP Surat city unit for two terms between 2010 and 2016. He won his first Assembly election in a 2012 bypoll from Surat West, following the demise of sitting MLA Kishor Vankawala. He went on to win the seat again in 2017 and 2022. According to some sources, Purnesh’s appointment might ease his way onto the national scene. Purnesh had filed a criminal defamation case against Rahul Gandhi in a Surat court in 2019 over the Congress leader’s remark implying that all thieves were called Modi, at a rally in Karnataka’s Kolar. On March 23 this year, Chief Judicial Magistrate H H Varma convicted Rahul, leading to his disqualification as a Lok Sabha MP. In August, the Supreme Court stayed the Congress leader’s conviction, following which he was reinstated as an MP. As UT in-charge, Purnesh says he hopes to connect the organisation and the administration. “We cannot interfere with the administration, but can develop a cordial relationship. We will definitely win the upcoming elections once a strong organisational base is established,” he says.',\n",
              "       'Farm to jobs, women to schoolkids, health to LPG: Spot the difference in Cong, BJP manifestosThe Congress on Tuesday announced its manifesto for Rajasthan promising a law to ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, doubling the insurance sum under the flagship Chiranjeevi health insurance from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, 10 lakh jobs in the next five years, including 4 lakh government jobs, as well as CCTV cameras in public places for women safety. Other big announcements include bringing the Vidhan Parishad to Rajasthan “for wider participation,” “stringent legal measures for hate speech” and constitution of “reconciliation and camaraderie committees at the district level to address hatred and enmity between communities.” Releasing the manifesto, party president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “We make only those promises which we can fulfil, be it in the Centre or states,” claiming that the Congress government fulfilled 95 per cent promises of its last manifesto for the state. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that as many as 3.32 crore people had given online and offline suggestions for the ‘Vision 2030’ document, which also became the basis for the party’s manifesto. आज राजस्थान कांग्रेस कार्यालय में कांग्रेस अध्यक्ष श्री@khargeने जनघोषणा पत्र लॉन्च किया।राजस्थान के सतत विकास के लिए कांग्रेस पूरी तरह तैयार हैं।#कांग्रेस_जन_घोषणा_पत्र2#कांग्रेस_फिर_सेpic.twitter.com/RrhcECw5UZ — Rajasthan PCC (@INCRajasthan)November 21, 2023 The Congress’s promise of “stringent legal measures for hate speech” comes at a time when theBJP, which released its manifesto for Rajasthan last week, has promised to set up a special cell to investigate ‘anti-Bharat’ sleeper cells across the state. Among the Congress’s immediate priorities after coming to power, those for farmers include a promise to enact a law to implement theMSP, to be called theMinimum Support PriceGuarantee Act, which will implement the Swaminathan Committee’s recommendations. The government will also provide an interest-free agricultural loan facility of up to Rs 2 lakh to all farmers from cooperative banks and withdraw pending cases against farmers related to their participation in protests. Gehlot said that the government will also form a commission, headed by a high court judge, which will hold a hearing before taking a decision on seizing farmlands. Similarly, at the release of BJP’s manifesto last week, BJP president J P Nadda had claimed that the land of 19,400 farmers has been seized and that the party will formulate a policy to ensure such farmers are compensated. The BJP manifesto had also stated that a notification to ensure that no farmlands are seized will be brought out in addition to an MSP of Rs 2,700 per quintal for wheat. With the Centre not backing the state’s demand of declaring the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) as a national project, the Congress manifesto says that the government will introduce a detailed plan for its staggered implementation. The BJP manifesto did not mention ERCP. For youth, the Congress says it will create 10 lakh employment opportunities in five years, out of which 4 lakh employment opportunities will be in the government sector. Additionally, a new scheme for the recruitment of youngsters at the panchayat level, gradually merging with government vacancies, will also be formulated. Moreover, the government will start a toll-free call centre and an e-Employment Exchange. In comparison, the BJP has promised 2.5 lakh jobs in the next five years as well as the setting up of a Rajasthan Institute of Medical Sciences and Rajasthan Institute of Technology – modelled on AIIMS and IITs – in each division, among several other measures. The Congress has also promised to increase the maximum number of employment days under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Indira Gandhi Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (IGUEGS) to 150 days annually, up from 125 days currently. For women’s safety, the Congress promises it will ensure installation of CCTV cameras in public places and security guards will be appointed in every village and urban ward. The party also promises to take necessary steps to reduce the average investigation time in sexual harassment cases and ensure 33 per cent reservation for women in cooperative institutions as well as in the police force. The BJP too had promised 33 per cent reservation of women in the police force, a women’s police station in every district, constitution of anti-Romeo squads, etc. The Congress also promises to provide a free coupon every month for free travel for women in the state-owned buses, in addition to existing discounts, and says it will come up with a scheme for special leave to be availed by women during their menstrual cycle. The Congress had earlier announced Rs 10,000 per annum for women heads of households while BJP had announced the Lado Protsahan Yojana where the government will provide a savings bond of Rs 2 lakh for a girl child. The Congress has repeated that it will conduct a caste census “to accurately determine population and allocate benefits for informed decisions on affirmative action”. For education, Congress says that it will provide education facilities till Class 12, instead of till Class 8, under the Right to Education (RTE) by bringing an education guarantee law in the state. The party had earlier announced free laptops or tablets for first-year students of government colleges and free English-medium school education. The BJP has promised Rs 1,200 as direct benefit transfer to schoolchildren from economically weaker sections for their school bags, books and uniforms. In the health sector, the Congress government will increase the amount of Mukhyamantri Nishulk Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana from the current Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh annually and also include ‘In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) package’ under this scheme “realising the profound emotional and social challenges faced by couples deprived of the joy of parenthood”. The party has also promised it will increase the facilities under free OPD/IPD in government medical institutions at the district and block levels. The BJP, meanwhile, has promised to launch the Rs 40,000 crore Bhamashah Health Infrastructure Mission to expand and upgrade health infrastructure in the state. It has also promised to set up 350 Jan Aushadi Kendras and at least one medical college in each district. Recruitment of 15,000 doctors and 20,000 paramedical staff along with adding 6,000 medical seats are also among promises made by the BJP in its manifesto. For businessmen, Congress has promised it will bring a ‘Vyapari Credit Card Scheme’, similar to the Kisan Credit Card Scheme, which will provide interest-free loans up to Rs 5 lakh to small traders, shopkeepers and young entrepreneurs. The Gig Workers Welfare Act will be amended to include auto and taxi drivers, “creating a more inclusive welfare system”. For good governance, the party promises to enact an “Accountability and Auto Service Delivery Act” which has been long demanded by social activists in Rajasthan. For LPG gas cylinders, the government had already announced that the Rs 500 subsidised cylinder will be extended to families under the NFSA (National Food Security Act) and BPL (Below Poverty Line) categories too. Now, the price has been reduced to Rs 400. In its manifesto, the BJP had announced cylinders at Rs 450. While Congress says it will implement measures and stringent punishments to curb incidents of paper leaks, BJP had announced it will set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate paper leaks during Congress rule. The Congress party had earlier announced a law to back the Old Pension Scheme with law and strengthen it. Moreover, a Congress government, if elected, will continue its schemes such as smartphones with internet for women. Keeping in mind the reserved castes, Congress says that it will establish an Equal Opportunities Commission “to ensure equal opportunities and fair representation”. Moreover, it will modify the percentage of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in accordance with the actual population to be enumerated in the census. Measures for minorities include drafting and implementation of “a robust Minority Development Policy”. Other announcements include developing an advanced system for predicting air pollution levels, promotion of night tourism in Jaipur, leveraging medical tourism, etc.',\n",
              "       'Decoding Politics: Why Muslim quota is sparking fireworks in Telangana frayIn its campaign for the Telangana Assembly polls, the BJP has repeatedly raised the issue of theexisting Muslim reservation in the state, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah calling it “unconstitutional” while maintaining that it will be abolished if the BJP wins the election. Addressing apoll rally at Jangaonon Monday, Shah said, “BJPis the party of Telangana people. When BJP forms government in Telangana we will abolish the unconstitutional 4% Muslim reservation.” He also repeated the BJP’s pledge to appoint a backward class (BC) leader as the CM if voted to power in the November 30 Assembly polls. Last Saturday, in his speech at a rally in Gadwal, Shah promised to scrap religion-based reservation and increase the quota of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) if the BJP clinches the election. He also accused the Congress and the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) of being “anti-BC” parties while claiming that only the BJP could benefit the backwards. The issue also figured in theBJP’s manifesto released by ShahinHyderabadlast Saturday, which besides several freebies also promised implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). The party’s manifesto, titled “Sakala Janula Saubhagya Telangana (welfare of the people)”, says that it would remove “unconstitutional” religion-based reservation, including the 4% quota for Muslims, in government jobs and seats in state educational institutes. The Muslim quota would be redistributed to OBCs, SCs, and STs, the manifesto states, adding that the party will set up a committee to draft a UCC for the state. On November 9, the Telangana Congress released its “Minority Declaration” for the polls, promising to increase the state annual minority welfare budget to Rs 4,000 crore. The party also pledged to conduct the caste survey within six months of coming to power in the state. The “Minority Declaration” stated that the Congress will ensure fair reservation for all backward classes, including minorities, in jobs, education and government schemes. Soon after Shah first raked up the Muslim quota at a rally at Chevella on the outskirts of Hyderabad in April this year, the Congress as well as the BRS and the AIMIM accused him of “undermining” the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court before which the issue has been pending. Senior Telangana Congress leader and ex-minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir has maintained that the 4% Muslim quota in jobs and education for socially and economically backward Muslims under the BC-E category is being implemented in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh based on the stay granted by the Supreme Court. He has said that the 4% Muslim reservation – announced by the then Y S Rajashekar Reddy government after the Congress stormed to power in the united Andhra Pradesh in 2004 – encompasses only 14 socially and economically backward groups among Muslims, identified by a Backward Classes Commission without affecting the quota of other communities. Shabbir has alleged that the BJP leaders have been attempting to “distort” these points to mislead the public and incite communal hatred. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has charged that Shah’s remarks exposed the BJP’s “double standards”. “On the one hand, Prime Minister Naredra Modi talks of reaching out to backward Muslims like Pasmandas and, on the other, the Union Home Minister announces that they will cancel Muslim reservation,” he said. What had the BJP to offer Telangana bar anti-Muslim “hate speeches”, Owaisi alleged, adding that the BJP-led Centre should instead amend laws to remove the overall 50% quota ceiling. BRS spokesperson Ravula Sridhar Reddy said Shah’s statement was another sign that “the BJP is greedy to grab power by any means”. “Amit Shah has turned the Muslim quota into a religious issue. He does not know the difference between constitutional and unconstitutional quota because the 4% quota is constitutional and does not breach the 50% ceiling,” Reddy said. In April 2017, in keeping with a poll promise, the BRS government led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR passed a Bill to increase quota for STs from 6% to 10%, and for Muslims from 4% to 12%, which would breach the 50% ceiling. But the Bill remains stuck as the Centre has not cleared it.',\n",
              "       'Trouble in Karnataka BJP as senior leaders revolt over Yediyurappa’s continuing gripAt least some prominent leaders of Karnataka BJP are unhappy that former chief minister and party Parliamentary board member B S Yediyurappa is back in the driver’s seat of the state unit, havinginstalled his son and first-time MLA B Y Vijayendra as its president, as well asloyalist R Ashoka as Leader of Opposition (LoP)in the state Assembly. Over the past week,BJPMLAs Basangouda Patil Yatnal and Arvind Bellad, as well as former state ministers C T Ravi and Arvind Limbavali, have criticised these appointments. Yatnal, who has a history of lashing out at Yediyurappa and Vijayendra, said he had informed the central observers about “those who were disloyal to the party” and made “adjustments” with the Opposition during the Assembly polls earlier this year. It was a barb aimed at the Yediyurappa camp, against which the camp led by BJP general secretary B L Santhosh had also made similar allegations after the BJP’s dismal show at the polls. In fact, a majority of the leaders and workers who have expressed their unhappiness about the new appointments are from the Santhosh camp. “The BJP should not become a party of one family. Workers won’t accept it,” Yatnal said on Friday, after he had walked out of the BJP Legislature Party meeting along with MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi, in which, earlier in the day, Ashoka had been elected as the LoP. Like Yatnal, Bellad was an aspirant for the LoP post. At the Legislature Party meeting, he had argued that having an LoP from North Karnataka would help the BJP win more seats there in theLok Sabhaelections. But that was not to be. He, though, welcomed Ashoka’s appointment, “keeping party interests in mind”. Both Yatnal and Bellad are from the dominant Lingayat community and form a majority in North Karnataka. Yatnal, a firebrand leader, has cultivated a large following among the Panchamasali subsect of the Lingayats, since their agitations in 2021 and 2022, demanding 2B reservation for the community. Last week, Limbavali, who has been the BJP general secretary several times, said party members were asking if Vijayendra had any qualification to be appointed as state president, other than being Yediyurappa’s son. Jarkiholi is another senior state BJP leader who is known to harbour reservations about Vijayendra, after their relationship turned sour during the former’s tenure as minister in the Yediyurappa Cabinet. Though there are fears that sidelining these leaders could be counterproductive, party leaders dismissed these, claiming that come the Lok Sabha polls, everyone would be found working for the party’s success. Trying to calm the swirling speculations of disgruntlement, Vijayendra on Sunday said Yatnal’s remarks had been misinterpreted. “He is free to express his opinions… He might have aired his grievances. We will find a solution, in consultation with seniors and national leaders,” he said. Speaking toThe Indian Express, BJP MLC Chalavady Narayanaswamy said he expected a compromise to be reached soon. “There won’t be any major impact on the party. Vijayendra has started taking everyone into confidence,” he said.',\n",

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Congress in-charge for Rajasthan Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, state party president Govind Singh Dotasra, manifesto committee chairman C P Joshi and ex-deputy CM Sachin Pilot will release “Jan Ghoshna Patra” at the state party office in Jaipur. During their campaigns, CM Gehlot and other Congress leaders have announced the party’s seven poll “guarantees”, which include Rs 10,000 per annum honorarium for women heads of families, subsidised gas cylinders at Rs 500 for over 1 crore households, free laptops or tablets for first-year students studying in government colleges, free English medium school education, purchase of dung from cattle owners at Rs 2 per kg, Rs 15 lakh calamity insurance for Chiranjeevi families, and a pledge to back the old pension scheme (OPS) for government employees with a law. TheBJPhas already released its manifesto on November 16, which has pledged various welfare schemes for women, youth and students. It has also promised to form a special police cell for probing “anti-Bharat” sleeper cells. Modi rallies and roadshow In Rajasthan, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiwill address two public meetings Tuesday — at Anta town in Baran and at Dusshera Ground in Kota. Union Minister and BJP Rajasthan in-charge Pralhad Joshi toured Anta and Kota on Monday and supervised preparations for the PM’s rallies. “It will be our largest public meeting in the history of Kota. People from nine Assembly seats in Kota and Bundi are expected to attend the public meeting at Dusshera Ground,” Joshi said. PM Modi will also hold a roadshow in Jaipur on Tuesday evening. The PM’s roadshow will be held inside the walled city of Jaipur and will start from Sanganeri gate, before moving through Bapu Bazaar, Nehru Bazaar, Kishanpole Bazaar, Choti Chaupad, Trilpolia Bazaar, Badi Chaupad and Johari Bazaar before ending at Sanganeri Gate in the city. Rahul rally Congress leader andWayanadMPRahul Gandhiwill address a public meeting in Udaipur district in Rajasthan. This rally will be held in Vallabhnagar Assembly constituency, where a triangular contest is expected between the Congress’s Preeti Gajendra Shekhawat, the BJP’s Udaylal Dangi and Deepinder Kunwar, wife of former Janata Sena Party MLA Randhir Singh Bhinder. Last Thursday, addressing his first rallies in Rajasthan — in Churu, Hanumangarh, and Ganganagar districts — in this election season, Rahul praised the welfare schemes of the Gehlot government with a promise of seven more, while warning that if the BJP is elected to power here, it will pull down the welfare net stitched by his party, as Hamza Khan reported. Repolling in MP booth Repolling will take place at a booth in Ater Assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district Tuesday, in accordance with the Election Commission of India (ECI)’s order. Voting will be held at booth number 3 of the polling centre number 71 at Kishupura between 7 am and 6 pm, the ECI order said. A district official said repolling was ordered as there was a breach in secrecy in the concerned booth after some people had shot videos of voting. Jarange-Patil on CM Shinde’s turf Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange-Patil will hold a rally in Thane, the bastion of Maharashtra Chief MinisterEknath Shinde. The announcement of his visit was made by the Sakal Maratha Samaj. Jarange-Patil’s visit comes close on the heels of an all-party OBC Elgar rally held to protest against the demand for inclusion of Marathas in the OBC category. The meeting saw state civil supplies minister and NCP MLA Chaggan Bhujbal steal the show, deploying rhetoric that no one from the ruling NDA has so far used since the Maratha agitation was reignited on August 29, as reported by Manoj Dattatrye More. Much of Bhujbal’s attack was reserved for Jarange-Patil, who has been spearheading the community’s demand for reservation. The Maratha activist’s visit to Thane is a part of his statewide tour, scheduled to culminate on December 24, the deadline set by him for the Shinde government to give Kunbi certificates for members of the Maratha community from across the state. AIADMK brainstorms for 2024 LS polls AIADMK chief Edappadi K Palaniswami or EPS will chair a meeting of district secretaries, office-bearers and other senior functionaries of the party to take stock of the preparations for the 2024Lok Sabhaelections. The high-level meeting to be held at the AIADMK headquarters will review preparations at all levels, starting from the booth committees. The move assumes significance as the party is holding such a meeting for the first time since exiting the NDA in September. Earlier this month, the ruling DMK concluded its zone-wise special meetings for its booth agents.

              "       'Decoding Politics: 5 reasons why ‘Indiramma’ has returned to TelanganaBharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, popularly known as KCR, has attacked the Congress by criticising the rule of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ahead of the November 30 Assembly polls. This was after party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra praised the former PM’s record at party rallies, particularly on tribal rights, and invoked her legacy to garner support. Why Indira? While campaigning in the tribal-dominated regions of Asifabad and Khanapur constituencies on November 19, Priyanka invoked the former PM’s legacy on her birth anniversary. She said people in Telangana still affectionately called Indira Gandhi “Indiramma”, 40 years after her death, adding that she gave the region’s Adivasis rights over their “jal, jangal, zameen (water, forests, land)”. “Many leaders would come and go. Many leaders worked for you. But why do you remember Indiraji? Why do you still call her Indiramma? The reason for that… she gave you land rights. Indira Gandhi understood the problems of the poor and distributed seven lakh acres of land to landless poor. She created the Integrated Tribal Development Authority and built lakhs of houses under the tribal sub-plan. She respected your culture and used to tell us how divine your culture is,” Priyanka said, in a reference to the land reforms initiated under Indira as PM. After she had lost from Rae Bareli in the post-Emergency 1977Lok Sabhaelections, Indira decided to contest from two seats in 1980, including Medak in present-day Telangana, with the Congress seeking to consolidate its hold in the South. While she won Medak by a margin of 2.95 lakh votes, in the united Andhra Pradesh, the Congress won 41 Lok Sabha seats out of 42. Indira was the Medak MP at the time of her assassination in 1984. The Congress has also named several of its current promised schemes after her, including programmes targeting women, below-poverty-line families and farmers. KCR’s counter In a string of recent public meetings, the BRS chief and Telangana CM has claimed that Indira Gandhi’s tenure was marked by starvation deaths, a growing Naxalite movement, and extra-judicial killings. At a rally in the Nagarkurnool constituency on Sunday, KCR reiterated the same. “The Congress is promising to bring Indiramma rajyam in Telangana. Do you know what happened under her rule? There were starvation deaths, the Naxalite movement started all over the country, and people were shot dead in fake encounters. Congress party failed to provide even basic drinking water in the country during their decades of rule. Even though rivers are flowing through this region, Congress failed to provide water. On what basis are they asking for votes now?” he said. The ‘starvation’ claim According to KCR, there was hunger in unified Andhra Pradesh under Congress and it was not until N T Rama Rao of the Telugu Desam Party came to power and offered rice at Rs 2 per kg that the starvation situation began to change. KCR was earlier a leader of the TDP. “It was a life of hunger and starvation till then. People should see what development under Congress in the last 50 years was and compare it with the BRS’s development in the last nine years,” the BRS chief said. “The progress Telangana has made since 2014 would be lost under Indiramma rajyam.” Among the BRS’s promises for the upcoming Assembly polls is for all ration card holders to be provided 5 kg of fortified rice through public distribution system (PDS) shops instead of normal rice. The Telangana angle On Monday, speaking at Manakondur Assembly constituency in Karimnagar district, KCR accused the Congress of merging Telangana with Andhra Pradesh (in the 1950s) “against the people’s will”. “There is no regime worse than Indiramma and Congress is promising to bring back those days. It was a time of scams and scandals and looting of public wealth. The Congress merged Telangana with Andhra Pradesh against the will of Telangana people due to which we have suffered for over 50 years,” he said. Under the State Reorganisation Act, 1956, several state boundaries had been redrawn and new states created along linguistic divisions. At the time the Telugu-speaking Andhra Pradesh was carved out of the Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu). A decade later in 1969, there was the first agitation for a separate Telangana state, which turned violent with clashes between protesting youth and the state Congress government. The movement was quashed, but more than 300 were estimated killed. Finally, the Congress-led UPA government would clear the creation of Telangana in 2014. The Narasimha Rao aspect Even while repeatedly attacking Indira and her legacy, the BRS has in recent years praised former PM P V Narasimha Rao, projecting him as a ‘son of the soil’. In 2020, the BRS had turned his 100th birth anniversary into a year-long celebration. KCR even wrote to PMNarendra Modirequesting him to bestow the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, on Narasimha Rao. These efforts were seen as attempts to push ‘Telangana pride’ and claim the Congress leader as a local icon. In June 2021, KCR unveiled a 26-foot tall statue of the former PM at P V Gnana Bhoomi on Necklace Road inHyderabad. Earlier this year, on Narasimha Rao’s 102nd birth anniversary, KCR credited the former PM with introducing the large-scale financial reforms in the early 1990s. “P V Narasimha Rao laid the foundation for India to become a modern country, and he had great political acumen and good governance skills,” KCR said. KCR’s focus on him contrasts with the Congress’s ambivalence regarding Narasimha Rao, who had strained ties with the Gandhi family. Lately, the Congress has been trying to reclaim Rao as its own, and its manifesto for this election says that if it comes to power, the party would name a district after the former PM, who was born in Warangal district.',\n",
              "       'Road to 2024: Hindutva plus welfare emerges as BJP pitch for polls, Congress not far behindWith polling in three states over and two more to go in the next 10 days, the campaign in this set of Assembly elections has been all about two issues – polarisation and welfare politics, with a clear divide. If polarisation seemed to be working for parties in urban areas, the discourse in the rural parts has been dominated by welfare initiatives. TheBJP, which is trying to wrest power in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, retain it in Madhya Pradesh and emerge as a significant electoral force in southern Telangana, has been as enthusiastic as other parties in promising schemes, which it earlier dismissed as “revdis” by the Opposition. (In the fifth state, Mizoram, the BJP remains a marginal figure.) This stress on schemes is especially true of Madhya Pradesh, where his women-oriented announcements are the main hope of its four-term Chief MinisterShivraj Singh Chouhan. Senior Congress leader and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar has even accused Prime MinisterNarendra Modiof “stealing” the Congress’s idea of giving guarantees – which was one big factor in the Congress win in Karnataka. In Chhattisgarh, where the campaign revolved around Hindutva issues on both the BJP and Congress side, the BJP unveiled several promises just four days ahead of the first phase of polling on November 7 – including cooking gas cylinders at Rs 500 for poor families, and Rs 12,000 per year financial assistance to married women. Party sources claim there has been instant positive reaction to the promises, bringing the BJP back in contention in the state. One indication of this was the reaction of the Congress and its fully confident CM Bhupesh Baghel, who within a week of the BJP’s announcements said a Congress government would give Rs 15,000 a year to all women if voted back to power. The BJP has the Karnataka example before it, where its campaign constantly talking of Bajrang Bali could not hold back the Congress momentum, which rode on its poll guarantees, including taking action against divisive outfits. BJP leaders say their calculation is that the party’s last-mile aggressive campaign, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took away JD(S) votes rather than the Congress’s. Not that Hindutva issues have been off the table this time. Addressing a rally in Raghogarh, Madhya Pradesh, recently, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said: “Do you want to have darshan of Ram Lalla or not?… You don’t worry about the expenses. Vote for the BJP and the party government will help you have darshan of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya free.” In Chhattisgarh, he talked of how the state was “Lord Ram’s maternal home”, with Kaushalya believed to have been born there. Shah kept reminding that PM Modi will inaugurate the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22, and said the BJP would introduce a Ram Lalla Darshan Yojana if it comes to power in the state. The Baghel government has a Ram Van Gaman Path project, tracing the route Ram is said to have taken in exile. In Rajasthan, the BJP has promised LPG cylinders at Rs 450 and free Scooty for meritorious Class 12 girls. Under the Lado Protsahan Yojana, the government has said a BJP government would set up a savings bond of Rs 2 lakh for a girl child. In Telangana too, the BJP has promised free travel to Ayodhya. In Madhya Pradesh too, the Congress’s undeclared CM candidate Kamal Nath has been walking the Hindutva thin line, to deny the BJP any advantage on the issue. Kamal Nath, who also announced a Ram Van Gaman Path project that later got stalled when his government fell, said that if voted to power, the Congress will ensure that a project to construct a Sita temple in Sri Lanka is revived. With the Congress showing willingness to engage with the Hindutva issue, mixed with its welfare politics, the BJP has been forced to follow suit. Before the current round of Assembly elections, the party promised free LPG cylinders for women in BPL families, and Rs 25,000 for pregnant women etc in Himachal Pradesh. Ahead of the Gujarat elections, the Centre announced two free LPG cylinders under the PM’s Ujjawala Scheme. It has tried to differentiate these from the Congress’s promises, claiming that its schemes are meant to “empower” women. But, BJP insiders admit: “Karnataka proved that guarantee schemes can sway votes… With economic issues increasingly taking the centrestage in elections, welfare politics and freebies are here to stay… Plus, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan where more than 90% of the population is Hindu, communal polarisation has its limits.” A leader added that the trend of such schemes may continue. “Hindutva issues may have some impact on a small section of the population, that too in urban or semi-urban areas. With price rise and unemployment back in the electoral politics discourse, the BJP cannot be seen as hesitant to announce popular sops even in theLok Sabhaelections.”',\n",
              "       'West Bengal ex-Advocate General: ‘It was a challenge to receive timely instructions (from govt) … could have achieved lot more with full support’Soumendra Nath Mookherjee resigned as West Bengal’s Advocate General on November 10, after just over two years in the position. Mookherjee took over from Kishore Dutta in September 2021. According to government insiders, under him, the government faced several setbacks in the courts which precipitated his departure. In an e-mail interview, Mookherjee discusses the circumstances leading to his resignation and his tenure as the government’s top legal adviser, and answers if he received sufficient support from the state administration. Though I did not tell the state government or any of its officials that I wanted to resign, during my absence from the country a news website reported that I had informed the government I wanted to resign and I was also informed by several lawyers that this was what was being suggested by the government. As the government did not contradict the report, I thought it proper on my part to forthwith tender my resignation to the honourable Governor. The most challenging part was the sheer volume and the diverse problems that arose in the day-to-day administration of the state on which my advice was sought and also the diverse issues in litigations involving the state. I was aware of the challenges and pressure that one could expect while holding this constitutional post. To my mind, I was clear that I had to seamlessly undertake my duties as the Advocate General and stay true to my role as an officer of the court. My caseload, often with insufficient assistance, was immense. I never shied away from an intensive work schedule. However, considering the criticality of several of the matters, the pressure to ensure the welfare objectives of the state were not adversely affected was considerable, especially on account of the sheer amount of fact-finding I had to undertake. Not always. Of course, there were some lawyers and officials who were diligent, thorough, capable, and dedicated, and would always be there to assist me. In important matters involving crores of rupees, or key matters affecting important state interests, I often found that on several occasions there were no state panel lawyers ready and available to assist me. Even the panel was changed without any consultation with me or taking any inputs or suggestions. It was a challenge to receive instructions on a timely and complete basis, and my office had to follow up multiple times to get information well into the early hours of the morning. The state government faced criticism and was snubbed by the Calcutta High Court in several cases. What was the reason? Cases where this happened would be where directions of the High Court had not been complied with within the time limits prescribed. It cannot be expected that the state government will always follow my advice in all matters. I am a lawyer and my advice will always be as per the law and my opinion will be irrespective of the preferences of the powers that be. Of course, the government may have its priorities – by which they may have to balance political goals. So, on several occasions, my advice, even if sought and given, may not have been followed in totality. Previous Advocate Generals have had, and have cited, different reasons for their resignations. I am not privy to the exact reasons or motivations. For me, the bottom line is that any professional should maintain their dignity and self-respect in the profession. To ensure this, I resigned. No, in fact, I made this clear in the meeting with His Excellency, the Hon’ble Governor of West Bengal last week. I will remember it as one of the highlights of my career but one where I feel a lot more could have been achieved if I had the full support of the state government. I have received overwhelming support from the Bar and the judiciary. I have always sought to uphold the dignity of the institution and tried to ensure that justice is delivered and is accessible to all.',\n",
              "       'IUML leader drops in for Pinarayi govt’s all-state splash, sparks off fresh buzz about Cong allyThe smoke and mirrors game between the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress in Kerala, and the ruling CPI (M) has now spilled over into the Pinarayi Vijayan’s Cabinet-on-Wheels programmes being held across the state. On Sunday, local IUML leader A N Aboobacker defied the Congress-led UDF’s call for a boycott of the meetings, dubbed ‘Nava Kerala Sadas’ and took part in a meeting hosted by the Chief Minister in Kasaragod. This was after Vijayan had criticised the Congress but pointedly kept silent on the IUML for Opposition parties not attending the Sadas, which are officially a government initiative to get public feedback on its functioning. The Congress-CPI(M) shadow war over the IUML may get worse in the coming few days, as the Nava Kerala Sadas traverse through the League stronghold districts of North Kerala. CPI(M) state secretary M V Govindan Monday said leaders from any party or alliance, including the UDF, were welcome to attend the Sadas. “Anyone and everyone can come, no matter which political party or alliance they belong to,” he said. Earlier, IUML legislator A Abdul Hameed embarrassed the Congress when he accepted the LDF government’s offer to become a member of the board of directors of the CPI(M)-controlled Kerala Cooperative Bank. This appointment came even as some IUML leaders, led by MLA U A Latheef, are entangled in a legal battle against the merger of the UDF-controlled Malappuram District Cooperative Bank with Kerala Bank. A division bench of the high court is slated to hear their pleas on December 4. When Kerala Bank was constituted by the previous LDF government in 2019, 13 out of the 14 district banks had agreed to merge with it. However, the Malappuram district panchayat, where the IUML is considered influential, held out. The group of IUML leaders who have moved court against the merger met state president Panakkad Syed Sadiqali Shihab Thangal and other senior leaders over the issue on Sunday. Party leader and advocate K Askar Ali, one of the petitioners, said the group shared its concerns with the party leadership over Hameed joining Kerala Bank. “Thangal gave us a go-ahead with the case and offered us full support. Hameed becoming a board member of Kerala Bank will not dissuade us from fighting the case,” Ali said. IUML state general secretary P M A Salam said the party had given its consent to Hameed’s move considering his experience in the cooperative sector. Though Salam exuded confidence that Hameed’s move will not affect the UDF in any way, pro-IUML social media handles have dubbed him as a leader who has betrayed the party. Shibu Baby John, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader and former minister, said the IUML should have examined the political situation before nominating Hameed as a board member. The RSP is also a part of the UDF. “The decision (to nominate Hameed) is right technically but issues in the cooperative sector should have been considered. It shows the political bankruptcy of the CPI(M), which is now trying to woo the IUML,” John said. Congress quarters also noted that Vijayan did not mention IUML legislator A K M Ashraf but slammed the Congress for giving the Nava Kerala Sadas a miss in the Manjeshwar constituency of Kasaragod district on Saturday. “The local MLA would not want to go into hiding when people of his constituency are thronging the programme. I do not want to blame his party (IUML) as he acted in accordance with the decision taken by the Congress,” the CM said. Vijayan did the same at Kasaragod, where IUML legislator N A Nellikkunnu stayed away from the Sadas. “I can understand the mental state of the MLAs who could not participate in the Sadas due to the (Congress) boycott,” he said. It was on the second day of the programme at Kasaragod that Aboobacker defied his party IUML’s public stand and participated in the CM’s interactions. “It is my responsibility to take up issues of the people with the Cabinet. I find the Sadas a venue to highlight issues. I do not know about the boycott,” Aboobacker claimed. The speeches being made by CPI (M) leaders and state Cabinet members at these interactions are also being watched closely. Their constant references to ‘‘threat by theBJP’’ is seen as their way of projecting that they are the only party that can take on the BJP, and that the Congress is not in the fight. Amidst the confusion over the new affiliations, senior IUML leader and MLA K P A Majeed told his party members to recall the party’s declaration. “In 1974, IUML leader P M S Pookoya Thangal had made the party’s stand clear on the Communist party. Those were the days when a section of the party was keen to shelter Communists, but Thangal categorically refused to have an alliance with any Marxist party. That declaration is still strong and there is no ground to change it,” said Majeed.',\n",
              "       'Akhilesh Yadav went in all guns blazing into MP, hopes to make a bangStung by what it calls betrayal by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh — where the national party ignored the Samajwadi Party’s (SP’s) call for alliance in the Assembly polls — party president Akhilesh Yadav led an aggressive campaign in the state, in a bid to hold on to its workers and to raise its bargaining power with the Congress for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls within the Opposition INDIA bloc. A belligerent Akhilesh, responding to media queries on alliance for the 2024Lok Sabhapolls, said, “Any discussion on an alliance will happen when the Lok Sabha elections are at hand.” The SP chief also attacked the Congress by saying there was no difference in principles and programmes between it and theBJP. SP leaders in MP admitted that the top leadership of the party has never been as involved in campaigning in the state in the past Assembly polls, with Akhilesh Yadav himself addressing 24 public rallies across 20 Assembly seats, besides leading “rath yatras” in three others. His wife and Mainpuri MP Dimple Yadav too joined the campaign and addressed rallies to ensure better connect with women voters. It was the first time she had campaigned outside UP. The couple also visited temples to pray for the victory of party candidates. Not only that. Akhilesh also sent his uncle and SP general secretary Shivpal Singh Yadav, and cousinDharmendraYadav, to campaign in MP constituencies bordering UP. Sudhakar Singh, a Thakur, who was recently elected the SP MLA from Ghosi in Mau district of UP, was deployed in Deotalab Assembly area of MP, along with senior UP OBC leaders Ram Achal Rajbhar and Lalji Verma. Earlier this year, Sudhakar’s bypoll win was projected as a victory of the INDIA bloc, with all its constituents, including the Congress, supporting the SP candidate. SP Madhya Pradesh president Ramayan Singh Patel later claimed that the aggressive campaign would damage Congress chances in at least 25 Assembly seats. He added that the top SP leadership campaigned a lot more this time because its local organisation was in a good position and was prepared to field candidates on more seats than in 2018. The SP has fielded 72 candidates this year, compared to 52 in 2018, when it had won one. Another party leader, though, said Akhilesh campaigned hard because the party unit in MP was confronted with an existential question, adding that the party had planned to contest 5-6 seats at a time it was holding alliance talks with the Congress. “Our workers, who had wanted to contest on other seats, had decided to stay neutral because the SP was not going to field them in case the alliance fructified. Some of them even joined other parties. When the Congress refused to ally at the last moment, the SP had only 15 days to put up a fight. Still, the top leaders camped in MP for several days to carry out an aggressive campaign, holding dialogues with workers. Certain remarks by state Congress chief Kamal Nath also hurt Akhilesh personally.” The SP leader also added that holding on to party workers was necessary ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “In case the Congress again refuses to ally for the Lok Sabha polls, the SP will be prepared to contest in Madhya Pradesh alone. For that, the party needed to maintain organisational strength on the ground,” he said. “If the SP goes on to win some seats in MP, or even manages to display its strength by damaging the Congress’s chances on some seats, its bargaining power for the Lok Sabha polls in UP and seats in MP bordering UP will increase,” said the leader. Party spokesperson Udayveer Singh said, “After the Congress betrayed us in MP, the party had to work hard to keep its workers united; also because we believe in contesting every election with complete dedication.”',\n",
              "       'Bathinda mayor ouster sparks buzz on Sukhbir, Manpreet equation as Warring pulls off a coupThe ouster of the Congress-ruled Bathinda Municipal Corporation’s first woman mayor Raman Goyal through a no-confidence motion has brought the relations between Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and his estranged cousin and ex-finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal back into focus in Punjab political circles. A loyalist of Manpreet, Goyal was expelled by the Congress in February this year. A month earlier, Manpreet, the former Bathinda urban MLA, had quit the Congress to join theBJP, which was described as “good riddance” by the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC)’s president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring. Both Manpreet and Warring had been at loggerheads for long even during the former’s stint in the Congress. Warring’s campaign pitch during the February 2022 Assembly polls was, “Sare Badal hara deo… (Defeat all Badals).” Thirty-one of the 50 councillors of the Bathinda civic body were present for the no-confidence motion against Goyal on November 15, in which four SAD councillors joined their 26 Congress counterparts to vote her out of her office. Stung by the development, Sukhbir ordered the expulsion of his councillors from the party. Seizing on the Akali Dal chief’s crackdown on his councillors, Warring, who is believed to have led the oust-Goyal operation, said, “Akali councillors were being asked to help the Manpreet Badal camp, but still 4 of them voted against the mayor, following which they were expelled… This again proves that both Badals are actually together despite belonging to different parties, which I have been saying for a long time.” Hitting back at Warring, Manpreet, while speaking toThe Indian Express, charged: “It is Warring who has been operating as the ‘B team’ of AAP Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann in lieu of personal benefits. I have said earlier too how Warring has been in cahoots with Bhagwant Mann at the expense of his Congress party and his associates. Warring’s silence over the arrest of fellow Congressman Sukhpal Singh Khaira (in a 2015 drug case) is a testimony to it.” Manpreet, who had initially been with the Akali Dal, also said that the removal of the Bathinda mayor was “another attack on Punjab’s interests”. However, Harinder Singh Dhillon, one of the SAD councillors who joined hands with the Congress against the mayor, said, “This no-confidence motion was bound to happen as the House is dominated by Congress councillors. How could a mayor who had already been expelled by her Congress party continue in her post in such a situation. Goyal has not joined BJP but she has openly been a Manpreet loyalist.” The election to the 50-ward Bathinda civic body was held in February 2021, in which the Congress bagged 43 seats with the Akali Dal winning the remaining seven. Manpreet, who was the finance minister in the then Congress-led government, lobbied successfully with the party leadership to ensure Goyal’s election as the mayor, even though the then Congress councillor Jagroop Singh Gill was eyeing the post and even protested against this decision. A five-time councillor, Gill defected to the AAP in August 2021. Subsequently, in the Assembly polls, the AAP fielded Gill from the Bathinda urban constituency, where he defeated the incumbent MLA Manpreet by over 68,000 votes. Sarup Chand Singla was the SAD’s candidate from the Bathinda urban seat. Following the poll results, Singla quit the Akali Dal amid swirling allegations that his bid against Manpreet was “sabotaged” from within the party. Singla had himself expressed such concerns during his campaign. When Manpreet switched to the BJP, Goyal along with several councillors openly expressed their loyalty towards him, following which the Congress expelled her along with four other councillors. Dhillon said, “When Goyal was chosen as the mayor, Gill protested…we had taken a stand in his favour even then. Later, the people of Bathinda chose Gill over Manpreet despite the fact that he had got many works done in urban areas. We supported the no-confidence motion against the mayor rising above politics as everything is not for political gains. If pardhan ji (Sukhbir) has to take action against us, what can we do. We still stand by our decision.” Although the Congress continues to be in a majority in the Bathinda Municipal Corporation, its tally has dropped to 30 due to a series of defections and expulsions since 2021, with the civic body’ next election scheduled for February 2026.',\n",
              "       'In her bastion, Vasundhara has her base but many ask who’s nextThe Hadoti region, still bearing remnants of the Bundi kingdom, has always been a stronghold of the BJP in Rajasthan. Both its stalwarts Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the first non-Congress chief minister of the state, and Vasundhara Raje won from this region. Shekhawat first won the Chhabra seat in 1977, and Raje has been representing Jhalrapatan for 20 years now. In this election too, theBJPappears to have an edge in the region, which has 17 Assembly seats spread across districts such as Kota, Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar. However, the excitement is muted and there’s no perceptible wave, similar to other regions of the state. There are two reasons for this. One is the absence of palpable anger on the ground against current CM Ashok Gehlot; there is appreciation for his government’s schemes and social justice initiatives but tinged by resentment against sitting MLAs, including the Congress’s. The second reason is the uncertainty over Raje’s place in the state BJP. “Woh hamare liye sab kuchch hain(She is everything for us). Raje is the only leader in the BJP who can make a claim to the CM post as of now,” says Rakesh Meena, a small businessman at Dara Station. “Everyone in my village talks about her. Our city looks like this because of the development works she has done. For us women also, she will be good,” adds Sonia Saini, a housewife. Rambabu, the priest at the Sadguru Kabir Ashram in Jhalrapatan, also credits all the local developmental projects, such as railway lines, medical college, cricket stadium, bus depot, to Raje. “Jhalrapatan is ahead of every town in the state only because of her,” he says. Raje clearly remains the tallest BJP leader in the region, appreciated for her “decision-making” and “strong leadership”, with her royal lineage an added plus. Her gradual eclipsing in the state BJP leadership hasn’t escaped the people, nor has her absence from party programmes, or the delay in announcing her candidature and that of her supporters. Incidentally, support for Raje has helped the BJP retain its influence in the Hadoti region even when other parts of the state voted for the Congress. In 2013, the BJP won 16 of the 17 seats from the region; in 2018, when the Congress came to power, it won 7 from here, but the BJP still got 10. The Gehlot government’s Rs 1,200-crore Heritage Chambal River Front Project in Kota is one way the Congress is trying to make its way into the region. Some Raje supporters like Rakesh Meena are keeping their fingers crossed and say that everything hangs on the post-poll scenario. “We know she is not a favourite of the BJP leadership, but she will change the game after the elections,” he says. Jehangir Patan, a truck driver and a resident of Jhalrapatan, adds: “This is Madam’s raj. Even if they don’t make her the CM, this will continue to be her raj.” At the same time, there are other BJP supporters who are looking ahead, reconciled to the possibility that Raje may not head a BJP government should the party win the November 25 election. “There are too many leaders in the BJP, the central leadership may not make her the CM. But it’s also a fact that people vote for the BJP because of Modiji now,” says G L Gaur, a retired government employee in Kota, adding that he has been a BJP supporter since its Jana Sangh days in the 1970s. Another ardent BJP supporter, Pavan Kumar, who sells kachoris by the roadside at Dara, says that while Raje is “the natural choice”, and that “the public only knows her”, “it’s the party’s decision. What can we do about it? Let’s see who it chooses.” Several names have been doing the rounds, pushed by different BJP camps as surveys give the party a good chance of winning. “We heard about Baba Balaknath and (Union minister) Gajendra Shekhawat. But Balaknath has to win his own seat (Tijara); he is having a tough time and could not even campaign in other constituencies. Shekhawat is not even contesting (in the elections),” says Mukesh Chawda in Bundi town. Ravi Dutt Sharma and Raghunandan Singh, retired government employees and residents of Haveli Katkaun, dismiss suggestions other than Raje. “We used to say, ‘Zindagi Jhalawar ho gayi’ to say life is in the gutter. But Raje uplifted Jhalawar,” Singh says. On the other two contenders, he adds: “Gajendra Singh (Shekhawat) is not known in this side of the state… We have not seen Balaknath.Sirf naam se koi Yogi nahin bante hein. Daadi banane se koi Modi nahi banta hai(Just because he is a Mahant, doesn’t make him Yogi Adityanath. Just because someone has a beard, that doesn’t make him Modi).” Balaknath, who belongs to the Nath religious sect like Adityanath, is fashioning himself as Yogi No.2, the image drawing as much on both being religious leaders, as on the UP CM’s reputation for being strict on law and order. Saying that Raje’s sidelining could impact the BJP’s showing, S Nagendra Ambedkar, Professor of Public Policy, Central University of Rajasthan, adds: “It all depends on the message she gives to voters in and around the Hadoti region. If it’s a negative message, the BJP will face an adverse impact. But if she keeps their hopes alive, it will not affect the party so badly.” Raje has been very careful about this, not making any remarks in public about the CM post nor party decisions. When her recent remark “I feel I can retire now”, while talking about the progress made by her son Dushyant, a three-term MP, was interpreted as a sign that she was ready to call it a day, Raje clarified immediately that she would continue in active politics and that retirement was never on her agenda. “She is being very careful. She is keeping the option open for the party leadership also,” a BJP leader involved with the state party functioning says. In fact, the two-term CM is the only state BJP leader who has been criss-crossing the state addressing rallies and doing road shows. Since the elections were announced, Raje has already visited at least 28 constituencies. Her supporters say that her absence from recent party programmes was only because she was not invited to the same. Then there are others who feel Raje should take her cue to exit, which usually does not come easy to politicians. Arvind Kumar, a hardcore BJP supporter and a businessman near Bundi Fort, says: “Raje has had her time. She should hang up her boots now. Let the youngsters take over.”',\n",
              "       'Why Gulab Chand Kataria’s ‘quiet return’ made noise in UdaipurMore than a month after Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot targeted Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar over his frequent visits to the state in the run-up to the Assembly elections, a similar controversy appears to rage in Udaipur as Congress leaders take on Assam Governor Gulab Chand Kataria over his extended stay in the city of lakes with days to go for the polls. Kataria, who was until recently the longest-serving MLA of Udaipur City and the Leader of Opposition, was spotted leaving the home of city Mayor G S Tank on November 13. According toBJPinsiders, Kataria met the party’s city councillors and leaders there. While the BJP maintained that Kataria had come to exchange Diwali greetings with party workers and leaders, the Congress accused the governor of electioneering despite holding a constitutional post. Congress’s Udaipur candidate and All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the governor must resign before touring Udaipur. It echoed Gehlot’s criticism of Dhankhar when the CM said there was “no logic” in the vice president visiting the state frequently during elections. Last week, Vallabh even shot off a letter to the Election Commission (EC) to complain about Kataria’s presence in Udaipur. Responding to the criticism, Kataria toldThe Indian Express, “I have been a representative of the people of Udaipur for 40 years. If on Diwali I come home and people meet me at my residence, what’s wrong with that? I have worked with these party workers for decades. They are like my sons. So, when I come to the city and they want to meet me, I can’t say no. If the Election Commission asks me about it, I will answer.” While Dhankhar’s visits and meetings were public and he even penned a poem on the “pain” of being dragged into a controversy, Kataria arrived quietly in the city and avoided the public glare till the news of his arrival became public after local media got wind of his visit to Tank’s house. Kataria did not make any statement at the time. Emphasising this, Vallabh said, “Every post has some dignity attached to it. If a Governor of another state begins touring the city secretly in the night, questions will be asked. It does not affect me … but if you want to come, first resign.” BJP sources said Kataria stayed in the city for a good seven days and departed only last Friday. They said the Governor’s presence in the city might be the subject of the Congress’s attacks but added that it was essential to ensuring that the party wins Udaipur City without any hiccups. Kataria has won the Assembly constituency seven times since 1977, with a winning streak going back to 2003. He was appointed Assam Governor in February. “He operated out of his residence, and held a series of meetings with local party workers and leaders,” said a senior city BJP leader. “All councillors were also called. He is the tallest leader of the party in the region and commands high respect among party workers. They have been demoralised since his departure. While this is a BJP bastion, being complacent can be dangerous. He has ensured that cadres are re-energised and do not lose sight of the effort they are required to put in.” BJP insiders also pointed out that the leadership had fielded old party hand Tarachand Jain from Udaipur City. Jain has held significant party posts in Udaipur district in the past and is an experienced campaigner, but is chiefly known as Kataria’s detractor. “Before Kataria was made Governor, Jain was trying to create his own space in the city. This led to some friction. So, those who have worked for decades under the leadership of Kataria find it difficult to align with Jain,” said a leader close to the Governor. Those who have traditionally voted for the BJP also bring this up. “Jain’s candidature was a bit of a surprise because he was perceived to be anti-Kataria. But later it was said it was with Kataria’s blessing that he was made a candidate. We don’t know what happened,” said Lakshit Sharma, a BJP voter in the city, underlining that he would continue to support the party. Some BJP sources, however, said whatever differences existed between the two leaders were recently buried in the party’s interests. Jain, in his media statements, defended Kataria saying it was the Governor’s city and he could visit any time. “There are traditional BJP votes which will come to the party. But Kataria ji could swing fence-sitters too. That is where we have to work harder this time,” said a BJP leader.',\n",
              "       'Denied a ticket by BJP, Vasundhara Raje’s former No. 2 fights back in no man’s landHuddled around a photo of B R Ambedkar in Daulatpura, a large crowd mostly comprising people from the Meghwal community has been waiting patiently for several hours. Finally, the music announces the arrival of the man of the hour. Yunus Khan enters the village amid much fanfare even as people line up to greet him while a few others dance beside the tractor, which has been modified into Khan’s election vehicle. A flag bearing Khan’s election symbol – an almirah – is hoisted over it. Chants of “Yunus Khan zindabad” and “Hamara neta kaisa ho, Yunus Khan jaisa ho(How should our leader be, he should be like Yunus Khan)” reverberate as a smiling Khan— a two-time former MLA from Deedwana and once considered the second most powerful person in ex-Chief MinisterVasundhara Raje’s government — greets the crowd and makes his way into the village, where the crowd rises to greet him. Khan proceeds to garland the photograph of Ambedkar before taking a seat. The crowd, comprising people from neighbouring villages too, is asked to address the gathering. First to speak is Prabhuram from the Bairwa community, who has come to Daulatpura from neighbouring Bagatpura village. “A meeting was convened by the Bairwa samaj at Bagatpura, where a decision to vote for Khan-ji was taken. He is our vikas purush,” he says as the crowd breaks into applause. “I was an MLA from this constituency for 10 years. The people gathered here are those who stood by me in my joy and grief. The list of atrocities committed against your communities over the past five years is long. The Palot case, especially, has shamed us all,” Khan starts his address. Khan’s anti-Congresselectionpitch resembles that of theBJP, but the upcoming election is different for Khan, who is contesting as an Independent after being denied a ticket by the BJP. Deedwana has an electorate of 2.66 lakh, of which Meghwals, Bairwas and other Scheduled Castes (SCs) make up 35,000 votes. The Palot case dates back to February 2022, when a 35-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped and tortured. The woman was found six days later, with insect bites on her body, and later succumbed to her injuries. Following her death, the woman’s family and the Opposition BJP accused a local Congress worker and a member of the Deedwana Panchayat Samiti of the crime and alleged that the administration was shielding him. Both the Congress worker and the incumbent Congress MLA, Chetan Dudi, hail from the numerically dominant Jat community, which has around 60,000 votes in the constituency. Training guns on Dudi, Khan says the role played by the legislator in the Palot case was despicable. “You are an elected representative and took the side of injustice. There can be no bigger sin than this,” he says. Khan had defeated Dudi’s father Rupa Ram in the 2003 Assembly elections while in 2013, he defeated Dudi. In 1998 and 2008, Rupa Ram had successfully contested the Deedwana elections against Khan. In 2018, the BJP fielded Khan from the Tonk seat, where he lost the polls to then Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot by a margin of over 50,000 votes. Following the denial of a ticket by the BJP, the former Deedwana MLA, who was introduced to politics by former Rajasthan CM and Vice-President Bhairaon Singh Shekhawat, finds himself in a tricky situation. As the former MLA looks to plant his feet again in his bastion, the 59-year-old has thus far refrained from launching scathing attacks on his former party and has targeted Dudi more frequently during his campaign. Khan’s 25-year-long political career, during which he has served as minister of transport and Public Works Development (PWD), has been entirely built on an anti-Congress narrative. The tribute to Ambedkar shows his strategy is to to restructure the social voting pattern in Deedwana and bring together the Muslim and Dalit votes to counter Dudi’s Jat vote bank. In his bid to get cross-community support, Khan has also been visiting temples, including those of folk deities of the Jat community, and meeting people across community lines. Muslims in Deedwana have voted for the BJP, contrary to their traditional pattern of voting for the Congress, when Khan was the BJP candidate. His supporters, this time round, are hoping that sympathy for Khan might cause them to rally behind him. The former MLA’s Kayamkhani Muslim community is 50,000-strong in Deedwana. The community also has a significant population in other parts of the state, especially Nagaur and some districts of the Shekhawati region. As his campaign enters Beri Choti, a Kayamkhani Muslim majority village, Khan speaks of the community’s valour and its contribution to the Army. “This is a village where Bharat’s sanskar and sanskriti flourish. The programme here did not start with the ayat of the Quran but with a tribute to Veer Tejaji. Hum Bharat mein rehte hai (We live in Bharat),” Khan said, drawing applause from the crowd. Veer Tejaji is a local folk deity. Here, in a rare display of discontent for his former party, Khan opens up on being denied a BJP ticket. “Aaj aap musalman ka naam le kar ke jo mere saath vyavhaar kar rahe ho, ye theek nahin hai (Today how you are treating me for being a Muslim, it is not right.) I have never allowed my caste, religion and my family to interfere. I always regarded the BJP as my family and stood by it whenever required. I have always thought of Deedwana to be my family,” Khan, flanked by supporters of different communities, says. A visibly emotional Khan then proceeds to tell the crowd about the sacrifices he has made for the BJP. “Which leader would give up a safe seat like Deedwana and contest from far away Tonk against Sachin Pilot. I, as a dedicated party worker of the BJP, did it to ensure no one could point a finger at me,” he says as the crowd chants his name and moves forward to greet him. Dudi, for his part, claims that Khan’s only goal is to cut anti-BJP votes by contesting as a rebel. “The BJP has denied him a ticket but he targets the Congress everywhere. It seems like he is working for the BJP. Why should we worry? Technically, he should cut into the BJP’s votes as he is a BJP rebel. But he has been fielded by the BJP so that he cuts into the votes of Congress. People have understood the BJP’s strategy of cutting votes by fielding him. Our fight is with the BJP. Khan stands nowhere,” the MLA says. The BJP has fielded Khan’s protege Jitendra Singh Jodha, a Rajput. He was also the party’s candidate from Deedwana in 2018, when he lost to Dudi by around 40,000 votes. “When he was in the BJP, he was our leader and our workers with him. Now, he is not in the party, but we will win in Deedwana. Our fight is against the Congress,” Jodha says. Oscillating between his anti-Congress rhetoric and asking the public to vote for him and not for the BJP, Khan finds himself in a no man’s land. His dilemma is aptly showcased in a video that has been doing the rounds on social media. “On the morning of (November) 25, after praying to your ishtadev (deity) and kamal (lotus)… ,” he is seen saying in the video before abruptly stopping and realising that the BJP’s election symbol – lotus – is no longer his.',\n",

But its reverberations might be much wider. The OBC and Vimukt Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJNT) rally was perhaps the first such move to bring together all 374OBC communities under one umbrella, where leaders across parties, including those from the rulingBJP, demanded a caste census across the country. The BJP government at the Centre has hedged its bets on calls for a caste census as the Opposition has made it a poll issue. With the Marathas too showing no sign of relenting on their demand for reservation, especially due to theirnew torchbearer Manoj Jarange-Patil,the rally could rattle the tenuous truce achieved by theEknath Shinde-Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government on the matter. Other speakers at the rally, besides Bhujbal, were also strident. “The one who speaks in the interest of OBCs will rule the country,” said Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Vijay Wadettiwar. Former minister and Rashtriya Samaj Party (RSP) leader Mahadev Jankar called for all OBCs to come together and float a party of their own, instead of depending on leaders of other parties. The next plan of several OBC organisations is to hold a rally in every district of the state. With Jarange-Patil insisting that his deadline for the government to implement reservation for Marathas is non-negotiable, the meetings are likely to stir up OBCs fear that bringing Marathas into the OBC category will reduce their share of reservation. The OBC leaders have been demanding that any such quota should be separate from OBC share. The rally would also have been worrying for the BJP, which is seen to enjoy the support of the OBCs in various pockets of the state. The community is not happy with the assurance given by its state government to provide Kunbi, and hence OBC, certificates to the Marathas as a way out. Earlier, the party had undertaken an OBCyatrain the Vidarbha region of the state as a damage control exercise. The Congress too has been trying to keep the OBCs in good stead as its state chief, Nana Patole, and Wadettiwar both hail from OBC communities. For Bhujbal, it is a win-win, as he was lauded by all OBC leaders for taking the lead against the Maratha protesters. The minister urging OBCs to reply in the same vein in case Marathas resort to violence is likely to have a long-lasting impact on state politics. It has also brought to the fore the divide between the communities. Bhujbal, who had receded into the background for a while after his arrest, appears to be trying to emerge as the tallest OBC leader in the state. He is also trying to forge a new social equation with his claims that he has the support of Dalits, Muslims and tribals. The minister’s attack on his own government has seen some demands for his expulsion from the Cabinet.Shiv Sena(UBT) leader and leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Ambadas Danve condemned Bhujbal’s language and questioned how he was still a part of the Cabinet. The government’s hands though are tied as any hasty move on Maratha quota could run into a court wall. In 2021, the Supreme Court had struck down reservation granted to Marathas by the earlier BJP-Shiv Sena government, deeming it unconstitutional as it breached the 50% ceiling for reservation. The Maratha agitation has gained fresh push since Jarange-Patil resumed his indefinite hunger strike, rejecting the government’s proposal of giving Kunbi certificates to Marathas of Marathwada region only. The state government subsequently agreed to provide Kunbi certificates to all Marathas across the state, which in turn drew an OBC counter-response.',\n",

While sharing her experience as part of a task at the house, Vichitra narrated a life-changing event that forced her to leave her decade-long career and the public eye. It was a sexual harassment incident on the sets of a Telugu film in Malampuzha, Kerala is the reason for her quitting films. Without revealing the name of the film and the perpetrators, Vichitra shared how she was harassed throughout her stay in the state for the shoot. Vicihitra said, “Based on the request from a now-deceased actor, I went to act in a film Malampuzha. That’s where I met my now husband too. So, he was working in the hotel I was staying. I had a very big issue there… you know there are issues around casting. I faced that the most in that film. The reason I disappeared after 2000 is because of that incident. It became a huge incident back then and was reported in papers. It became a scar that won’t heal. Bigg Boss, on that day, was telling we should face our demons. If I speak about this, maybe, I will win over my demon.” When Vichitra arrived at the hotel, the management threw a party as they got ‘Three Star’ status. Vichitra was invited by the manager (her husband now) to attend the event. “I am meeting the hero of the film there for the first time. He looked at me and the first thing he asked me was, ‘Are you acting in the film?’. When I said ‘yes’, he replied, ‘Come to my room.’ He didn’t bother asking my name or who I am. I was shocked. I didn’t know what kind of gesture is that. That night, I went to my room and slept.” Trouble ensued for Vichitra from the next day. “The shot wouldn’t happen on time. There were a lot of problems on the sets. After six, everyone got drunk and started knocking on my doors. I still remember the banging of the doors. I told the reception not to connect any calls and leave me alone. I wanted to do my work and leave. But that didn’t happen. The issues kept cropping up.” That’s when the hotel manager stepped in and helped Vichitra. “He was not even a friend then, but he knew what was happening and asked me how he can be of help. I told him I want to change the room and no one should know where I am. So throughout the schedule he managed to shift me to different rooms. I would be in the room opposite to my previous room and I would still hear the banging there. It was not just one person. There would be multiple people. I felt bad about myself.” However, things got worse as the perpetrators got irritated and wanted to teach her a lesson. On the next day, during the shoot which involved a riot scene in a village, Vichitra was touched inappropriately. When it happened for the third time, she got hold of the guy and dragged him to the stunt master to complain. “The stunt master removed my hand and gave me a tight slap. I was stunned. I looked around if someone came out to my help. No one did. I walked out of the set. I was filled with fear, anger, and embarrassment.” Vichitra contacted the actor’s union inChennai. She was asked to return from the sets and write a complaint. However, despite her efforts, nothing happened to the abusers. “No one came to help me. It need not go to the extent of rape… even manhandling and slapping someone are crimes. I was then asked to go to police and not the Sangam.” Vichitra broke down and said, “Nothing happened. I didn’t know if I can continue to act. I was worried if my family can survive. Why this cine field? Not even one guy turned up to help me. Maybe, everyone thought I deserved it because it is a normal thing in my life. I don’t know. The president of the Sangam told me to forget all that and go back to work. I can’t forget that till date. Then my husband (the hotel manager) was helping me with the investigation. He asked me one thing, ‘Is this what you are working for? If you don’t have dignity at a place, why be there?’ It felt like a slap. I thought film industry was my family. I realised it wasn’t. I wanted to find my family. That’s when I quit the film. Then I went into a shell. My husband wanted to marry me. He has given me a dignified life and three sons.” Vichitra concluded by saying that any crime needs to be addressed immediately because it is being asked of women. Earlier, Vichitra asked her fellow contestant Akshaya to report such issues without delay, which became a topic of discussion.',\n",

              "       'Anurag Kashyap had medical emergency after being gifted bag of marijuana by fan, says misconception of him being a ‘ganjedi’ hard to shake offDirectorAnurag Kashyapsaid that the one misconception about himself that he’d want to change is that he enjoys partaking in marijuana. In an interview recently, the filmmaker said that he is actually allergic to the substance, and recalled a story about having to take an emergency antihistamine when a fan gifted him a box full of joints at a film festival. Appearing on the Flip the Script with Shubra podcast, Anurag said, “Because I’ve made Gangs of Wasseypur and Raman Raghav, people think I’m a psychopath. People are initially very scared of meeting me. And when they meet me, they get totally overwhelmed because I’m completely opposite of their perception. I can’t change that. A lot of people think that I smoke up. Often, when I get trolled, people call me ‘ganjedi’ and ‘nashedi’. But I just roll my cigarettes; they don’t even know I’m allergic to it. I get serious asthma attacks even if I smell somebody smoking pot around me.” And this is what happened at the Toronto International Film Festival once, when a fan approached Anurag with a special gift. Recalling the story, the director said, “I was in Toronto for the festival, and somebody came and said, ‘I’ve got a nice gift for you’. He had a wrapped bag, with flowers on it. And because I’m allergic to it, I can smell it from a distance. I said, ‘What’s in that bag’. He said, ‘Something you’d love’. I opened the bag, and he had rolled joints in it.”\\xa0Anurag told the man to take the marijuana away immediately. “I said, ‘What’s wrong with you? Take it away from me, take the smell away’. I had to take an antihistamine immediately. It’s that bad for me. But it’s perception. I can’t change that,” he said. Anurag has recently opened up about the many health issues he experienced during the pandemic. The filmmaker said that heslipped into a depressionfollowing professional setbacks, and then had two heart attacks. This put him on steroids, which had an impact on his weight. He said that he is taking care to get back to his best, one day at a time. Click for more updates and latestBollywood newsalong withEntertainment updates.

              "       'Sam Bahadur song Banda: ‘Unstoppable’ Vicky Kaushal is all action and no talk in latest number. WatchA week after the release of the first song, titled “Badhte Chalo“, the makers ofMeghna Gulzar’s Vicky Kaushal-starrer Sam Bahadurhave unveiled another powerful track, “Banda”, which is like an ode to the “unstoppable” Field marshal Sam Manekshaw. The 126-second music video opens with scenes of Manekshaw (Vicky Kaushal) undergoing rigorous training in his early days. As the song unfolds, glimpses from various phases of his life are depicted, showcasing his charisma and unwavering determination. The lyrics, meanwhile, highlight his silent yet resolute approach: “[He] doesn’t listen, nor does he talk; he simply continues to do [what needs to be done].” The video also offers a sneak peek into Manekshaw’s personal life, featuring moments with his wife Silloo Manekshaw (Sanya Malhotra), and a conversation between “India’s greatest soldier” and the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (Fatima Sana Shaikh). Composed by Shankar Ehsaan Loy trio, Banda has been penned by Gulzar and sung by Shankar Mahadevan. Written by Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Shrivastava and Meghna Gulzar, the film is bankrolled by Ronnie Screwvala under the banner of RSVP Movies. Sam Bahadur’s trailer, which the makers released a fortnight ago, had shown Sam Manekshaw’s exceptional leadership and the formidable challenges he faced. The first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal, Manekshaw played a pivotal role in India’s victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war, leading to the creation of Bangladesh. The film also stars Neeraj Kabi, Edward Sonnenblick, Govind Namdev and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in key roles.

              "       'Content creators participating in reality shows: A fad or means to discover talent?After ruling over the internet, social media influencers and content creators have now taken the reality show space. They have been brought on board as contestants on several talent-based shows. The latest season of Indian Idol has the viral policemanRajat Rathoreas a contestant, while MasterChef India has many influencers onboard. Even dance-based shows like Dance Plus, Dance Deewane and even India’s Best Dancer have seen several social media stars competing. But is it a fair practice? Do they have an upper hand in the competition? How do show creators pick these contestants? And does their presence give the show a boost? Armed with these contestants, we decided to reach out to industry experts to decode the trend of content creators on reality shows. Michelin Star awarded-chefVikas Khanna, who is also a judge on MasterChef India shared that the show has always been a way for home cooks to extend their craft and business. He shared that social media has become an important part of the food business and it was pertinent that they also have social media creators on board. “Also, no one is critiquing their food. When they are on this show, they get refined. That also helps them start their restaurant or food businesses. They get the attention of investors and publishing houses for their future books. I always say that MasterChef India is like a boot camp or university, and these degrees always have a benefit,” the celebrity chef toldindianexpress.com.   A post shared by Sony LIV (@sonylivindia)  Producer Ranjeet Thakur also shared that while people are noticing this because of social media, they have always hunted and picked good dancers across India through networking. “Earlier, these dancers would send us their videos or someone in the team would suggest having watched someone perform somewhere. This is not a new practice. It’s just become easier as social media has given us unlimited access to talent across the country.” For these creators, being on a national platform immediately gives them an instant boost. Talking about the same, Harish Closepet, better known by his Instagram page ‘Harry’s Lunchbox’, shared with us that there are ‘pluses and minuses’ for him on the show. “For me, I am not camera shy and can give content, which helps in reality shows. However, personally, since I make lunchboxes, it’s tough for me to unlearn and start plating as per the show’s requirements. I must also add that even though I have cooked for many years, my page is relatively new. So I was taken on the show for my talent rather than my social media content.” Audition process Rukhsaar Sayeed, one of the top contestants on MasterChef India, shared how she received a call from the team for an audition. She shared that they had seen her page and even followed her entrepreneur journey, and invited her to be on the show. Initially reluctant, she decided to give it a try and now feels she made the right choice. Chef Vikas Khanna had also pickedNayanjyoti Saikialast year for the show after seeing his Instagram page. Nayanjyoti went on to win MasterChef India. “Honestly, I do not have many followers and am not too active on social media. However, because I have done my PhD in food technology, the team may have felt that I should be on the show. After my research, rather than taking up a job, I decided to start my own business and give employment to women in the valley, and make them financially independent. I feel that a platform like this is very important as one gets to put across their talent and even beliefs out there,” she shared.   A post shared by Sony LIV (@sonylivindia)  Khanna said that while a few contestants may get invited for the audition, they do need to cross the gruelling ‘test of taste’ before they are finalised. “Just like everyone else, they too give an audition. They only have a slight upper hand as they are more comfortable with cameras and also understand presentation. But that’s their doing, not ours,” he smiled to share. Connect with the audience Vikas Khanna said that reality shows are always about these contestants, and as they grow stronger in competition, they also find a connection with the audience. He shared that given they already have a fan following on social media, it helps the show as more people stand up for them, cheer for them, and also tune in because of them. Thakur, on the other hand, shared that while their being on the show helps them get a platform, the show hardly benefits from it. He mentioned that content creators’ fandom is majorly virtual and they do not care to watch a TV show, even if it’s about their favourite star. He reasoned how Bigg Boss may get YouTubers and social media stars but the show is usually won by a TV face. “We need to understand that they are on this show only for their talent and popularity. There can be more famous people but if they are not talented, they will not survive. Look at these social media stars, do people go and buy their film tickets? There is a clear demarcation there.”   A post shared by Ranjeet Thakur (@tranjeet)  The Future Ranjeet Thakur mentioned how virality would always be a phase and cannot become a sustainable career. He said that while a video of a dancer or singer may get them many followers and instant fame, it doesn’t guarantee work. Referring to the ‘Just looking like a wow’ trend, the producer said that today anything and everything can blow up but a new viral trend would be lurking close. “Everyone is using this woman’s ‘so beautiful’ line but are they buying salwar suits from her? No. Her going viral will not have any positive effect on her business. Yes, she would get short-term fame but what’s next? We don’t think about that,” he said. For Vikas Khanna, however, social media has become an important part of the food ecosystem. He added how the medium has opened up so much and one cannot disregard their importance. “They do help in diverting traffic or changing the direction and opinions. So one has to honour them. Today, young kids have gotten into blogging and critiquing and they do have a hand in driving the economy.” The youngest contestant on the show, Kenny G from Bengaluru, said that while many creators enter reality shows to give their talent a platform, it’s the other way round for him. All of 18, he shared that while he has been toying with the idea of creating content, now that he is a known face among food fans, it would make his journey easier. He also mentioned how his parents, who were skeptical about his career choice, have finally given him the go-ahead. “They always felt it was a hobby but now they want me to start creating content and take cooking seriously.”',\n",

              "       'Anurag Kashyap reveals he broke down every room in his house to keep family and ‘riff-raff’ out: ‘I’ve isolated myself’Director Anurag Kashyap said that he was ‘heartbroken’ when Phantom Films, the production company he co-ran with filmmakers Vikramaditya Motwane, Vikas Bahl and Madhu Mantena, closed down following the #MeToo allegations against Bahl. But he bottled up his emotions and doubled down on work, whichaffected his health adversely. In a new interview, Anurag said that he has taken steps to take back control of his life, which includes shutting out people and isolating himself. For the longest time, he said on Flip the Script with Shubra podcast, he would welcome strugglers into his house and offer his mentorship to anybody in need of it. But how can you give water to somebody with an empty glass, he reasoned in the interview, explaining why he made the decision to focus on himself, and what that implies. “My house had a lot of rooms, and every time somebody was passing through, they’d stay there. I broke all the rooms. There’s only one room.” He continued, “This time, consciously, I’ve the kitchen also out. I need my isolation. I’ve isolated myself. I’m with my books and my movies and my shows. Even if family comes, I say, ‘I don’t have space in my house’.” Anurag said that drawing these boundaries has fuelled his creativity, and that he hasn’t written this much in over half a decade. He said, “When my company broke down, I was heartbroken. But instead of dealing with that pain, I rushed into work. I made film after film, series after series. Emotionally, I was all over the place, but I didn’t accept it. Suddenly, the lockdown happened, and there was nothing I could escape to. And I had to face myself, and I imploded.” Anurag said that he has always been a hyper-sensitive person, but had to learn to take a step back in order to fix his own problems first. Asked how he keeps the ‘yes men’ and the ‘riff-raff’ out of his orbit now, he said, “Earlier, I was surrounded by a lot of people. The idea was to encourage them. And now, it’s tiring for me. People still come to me thinking I will do something for them. But I say no, I’m not the charitarian.”',\n",
              "       'Ranbir Kapoor says his character in Animal as ‘tough and uncompromising’ as Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy, but more ‘relatable, human’Ranbir Kapoor’s character in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s upcoming film, Animal has been drawing attention ever since thefilm’s teaserandsongswere released. In a recent interview, Ranbir has shared how his character in the film is similar yet different from Arjun Reddy andKabir Singh, the infamous protagonists of Vanga. He also shared that Animal is a film which will keep the audience at the edge of their seats. While speaking to Variety, Ranbir clarified that the reason he chose to do Animal was not the success of Vanga’s previous films,Arjun Reddyand Kabir Singh. Instead, it was the script of the film. However, he did enjoy watching Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh. Ranbir said, “I was really drawn to the script of Animal. It’s a unique and intense story that immediately caught my attention. As for watching Arjun Reddy or Kabir Singh, I must admit that I did watch both films and found them to be incredibly powerful and impactful. However, my decision to accept Animal was not solely based on those films.” The actor looked at the opportunity to do Animal as a chance to “explore new dimensions’ in his acting journey and a way to break out of his on-screen image of a lover boy. Calling his character “multi-dimensional and complex”, Ranbir accepted that his character in Animal has traits of Vanga’s leading men. He shared, “My character in Animal does possess some of the traits typically associated with Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s protagonists. He is indeed tough and uncompromising in certain aspects.” But there are some traits which also set him apart. Ranbir added, “While he may exhibit strength and determination, there are also moments of vulnerability and internal conflict that make him more relatable and human.” In the movie, Ranbir plays a doting son to his father, played by Anil Kapoor. He is also shown to be madly in love with Rashmika Mandanna’s character. Bobby Deol will be seen as an antagonist in the drama. Ranbir is confident that the narrative and characters of Animal will keep the viewers ‘captivated’. He described the film as, “Animal is a gripping and intense film that delves into the depths of human emotions and relationships. It explores the complexities of life and the choices we make, with a narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat.” Animla will hit the screens on December 1, along with Meghna Gulzar’s Sam Bahadur, starring Vicky Kaushal in the titular role.',\n",

The fifth instalment in the YRF Spy Universe, Tiger 3’s songs, composed by Pritam, had become chartbusters, with the fast number “Leke Prabhu Ka Naam” winning the hearts of many. The song, which has already accumulated over 103 million views on YouTube, features bothSalman KhanandKatrina Kaifbringing their A-game. Meanwhile, choreographer Vaibhavi Merchant, who composed the steps for “Leke Prabhu Ka Naam“, recently shared insights into her experience working with the two actors and opened up about whether it was a challenge to make Salman Khan dance. “It is a challenge for anyone to make him dance if you give him steps out of his comfort zone in terms of his body language, body structure and his physicality,” she said during a chat withDNA. “You must understand the psyche of the actor and if he is comfortable doing those steps. You need to bring in something that will excite both, Salman and his audiences. Our cinema is about envisioning our superstars to come and do something which is beyond larger than life, and that’s what I always attempt to achieve,” Vaibhavi added. The National Award-winning choreographer also hailed Katrina Kaif and said, “I have known Katrina even before she joined films. She had briefly come in through someone to train. She has made an immense growth since then and with the amount of hard work she puts in, she has always been at the forefront through her dancing skills.” Referring to thecontroversy surrounding the “Besharam Rang”track in Siddharth Anand’s Shah Rukh Khan,Deepika Padukone-starrerPathaan, she said: “Whatever happened with Besharam Rang, eventually in hindsight, it did what it needed to do, which is it generated not just a conversation but created a havoc.” “The good part is that the people who believed in it were answering on all our behalf, people realised that it was completely baseless and unnecessary. I was amused by the radicality of it because there are far more things happening in the world which need immediate attention and an actress’ costume colour was the least of it,” she observed.',\n",

At the IFFI Masterclass, Sunny sat down for a discussion with directors Anil Sharma, Rajkumar Santoshi and Rahul Rawail. The directors revealed howSunnyalways listened to them, despite sometimes being the producer of the film. Rahul also recalled how Sunny, who was the hero in a film, stepped in when the duplicate failed to do a scene. Santoshi, who helmed Ghayal, was explaining a scene in the film and said that Sunny had to save the heroine from goons in the particular scene. He said, “Sunny usually does not smoke cigarettes, but in that film, he does it with style. Then he turns back and hits the goons, both fall on each side and the fight scene is over. Sunny then sees there is blood on his hands and he wipes it on the boss’s shirt (in the film) and leaves.” After looking at the scene, stunt director Tinnu Anand told Santoshi, “Tinnu said, ‘No, we want a fight with Sunny.’ I went and told Sunny, ‘this is what I want and Tinnu is saying this.’ Sunny said, ‘Raj is right. Fight is not required here.’ Sunny never interfered with the director. Even though he could have done it.” Rahul also took a trip down the memory lane and said, “Sunny does not say no to anything. While filming Betaab, Sunny had to tame a wild horse. We thought ‘Sunny cannot do this.’ So Tinu Varma was the duplicate. But Tinu Varma started screaming while filming the shot. So finally, Sunny did the duplicate shots as well. So I said that this has happened for the first time that a hero became the duplicate’s duplicate.” Sunny was recently seen in the blockbuster film Gadar 2, marking his solid return to the box office.

              "       'Netflix abandoned Vikramaditya Motwane’s Indira Gandhi documentary, Anurag Kashyap’s magnum opus after Tandav controversyWhen Warner Bros announced that it wasn’t going to release the completed Batgirl film and was instead going cut losses with a tax write-off, the move was described as unprecedented. The studio had already spent nearly $100 million on the superhero movie. WB did the same thing again recently with the Coyote vs Acme film, and this time, the industry didn’t stay quiet. Faced with growing pressure, the studio allowed the filmmakers to shop Coyote vs Acme around to other interested distributors, instead of letting it sit on a shelf. But decision-making like this has been common in the Indian streaming industry, the Washington Post recently reported. Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Prime Video ask for extensive changes to be made to stories involving politics, caste, and religion, when they aren’t ‘politely passing’ on the projects altogether. “Why greenlight it, then change your mind?” asked Anurag Kashyap, whose magnum opus three-part adaptation of Suketu Mehta’s Maximum City was abandoned by Netflix, sending him into a depressive spiral. The same streamer alsocancelled all plans to release director Dibakar Banerjee’s completed film Tees, reportedly about a Kashmiri family’s struggles in current day India. Banerjee shot the film in 2020 and delivered it to Netflix last year. After months of non-committal communication, the streamer informed him that it would not be moving forward with the release. “Netflix has never given me any other reason except they don’t know if this is the right time to release the film,” Banerjee told Deadline, adding that he was barred from screening the film at festivals, but has been allowed to show it to potential new buyers. Also axed by Netflix is director Vikramaditya Motwane’s documentary Indi(r)a’s Emergency, which recently screened at the Jio MAMIMumbaiFilm Festival and the Dharamshala International Film Festival. The Washington Post reported that the streamer invested over $1 million into the project, before getting cold feet about the parallels that it draws to the current regime’s tactics. Netflix has since relinquished the rights to the film. Coincidentally, each of these three filmmakers was instrumental in launching the streamer in India. Motwane and Kashyap worked together on Sacred Games; Kashyap also worked on the anthology films Lust Stories and Ghost Stories with Banerjee. Netflix responded with this statement: “We have an incredibly broad range of Indian original films and TV shows, all of which speak to our long standing support for creative expression. This diversity not only reflects our members’ very different tastes, it also distinguishes our service from the competition.” One of the first completed shows to be cancelled before release was the political satire Gormint, which was once set to star the lateIrrfanKhan, who was replaced by Manav Kaul. The nine-episode series was shut down following the Tandav controversy, which is seen as a pivotal moment for not just Indian streaming, but the Indian film industry as a whole. A section of the right-wing took offence to certain scenes in the Prime Video show, which resulted in numerous police complaints. The scenes were eventually removed from the show, and apologies widely disseminated. “At Prime Video we take our responsibilities seriously and make our programming decisions thoughtfully,” the Post quoted Prime Video as saying in response. “It is creative evolution in reverse,” Gormint direct Ayappa KM told the Washington Post. “Only passive, thoroughly sanitised content stands a chance on most platforms now.” “OTT ki aaj ki date mein himmat nahi hai, Tandav ke baad sab dar gaye hain(OTT has lost its spine, everybody is scared after Tandav),”Anurag Kashyap told Mashable recently. “You wanted to make sure that you are not making the same mistakes that happened on Tandav,” a former Netflix employee told the Post.',\n",

              "       'Want to delve into Korean cuisine? Here are 5 types of kimchi you can tryAchaar. A food group Indians can hardly do without. And who thought we would have this in common with Koreans?The Korean kimchiis, in its basest form, anachaar,with all the makings of one. Made with salted and fermented vegetables, kimchi is perhaps the staple of Korean cuisine. I once heard an actor in a K-drama say that kimchi might be able to exist without Korea but Koreans could never be separated from their kimchi. Though it is essentially made with vegetables, authentic kimchi often includes fish sauce in its recipe so if you’re a vegetarian, make sure to check the ingredients before you eat it. Chef Hanumanta Deora, head chef, Barn@Food Square, presents us with 5 types of kimchi you can try. “Each variation introduces an enticing deviation fromthe cherished Korean classic,” he tellsindianexpress.comin an interaction. Whether you prefer the classic spiciness or want to opt for a milder, refreshing experience, these five types of kimchi will deliver. A staple in Korean cuisine, this kimchi variety features Napa cabbage fermented with a harmonious blend of Korean red pepper flakes, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. It embodies the quintessential spicy and umami-rich profile that has made kimchi renowned worldwide. Characterised by its light and watery base, Water kimchi is a delightful departure from the usual spice. Featuring Korean radish, carrots, cucumber, green onions, ginger, and garlic, all submerged in a brine, this variation delivers a crisp and refreshing taste. For those seeking a departure from the cabbage-centric varieties, pakimchitakes green onions to the forefront. Coated in a paste of Korean red pepper flakes, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic, this kimchi offers a bold and savory alternative. Diverging from the traditional red hue, white kimchi excludes the red pepper flakes. Instead, it embraces a milder yet equally flavorful combination of julienned Korean pear, radish, pine nuts, salt, sugar, ginger, and garlic, offering a refreshing departure from the norm. Oi Sobagi presents a unique twist with small cucumbers stuffed with a flavourful mixture of Korean radish, red pepper flakes, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. The result is a delightful marriage of crunch and spice in every bite. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'How storytelling for children has evolvedToday, there is a fantastic range of children’sbooks, for ages 0 to teens, with parents taking out time to find the right ones for their kids. More than that, sharing and discussing the books has become of prime importance. “Quantity time, not quality time, is important,” feels educator, naturalist, and writer Zai Whitaker. The age-old maxim of ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ cannot be taken for granted becausechildrenquestion what happens in stories far more than they used to, pointed out author Deepa Agarwal who writes both for children and adults. “They are not passive listeners. Even folktales which used to be readily accepted as they were, require explanations and logical justifications. A storyteller needs to rewrite the script to capture the attention of her audience and make sure the narrative and characters have credibility, especially now that the electronic methods of storytelling with startling special effects are grabbing the attention of the young,” she said. Readingabout other beliefs, different cultures, and ways of life not only broadens the mind but promotes understanding and empathy. “The commonly mentioned benefits like gaining knowledge, increasing vocabulary and communication skills, improving concentration, enhancing creativity and reducing stress cannot be emphasised enough too,” said Deepa, who has written books likeFolk Tales Of Uttarakhand, andThe Teenage Diary of Nur Jahanto name a few. Parents should begin as early as possible by letting babies handle cloth or vinyl books, sing lullabies, repeat rhymes, and read aloud to them. “This develops a lifelong connection with books. The choice of reading material is also important, and parents should be sensitive to their child’sresponsesto stories. Reading aloud should continue even after a child has learned to decipher words and sentences as a way to spend quality time with a child,” Deepa said. Zai’s 18 years of teaching English, and “slyly trying out my writing on my students”, flagged three things for her: that the writing, however simple, should have exciting ‘aha’ moments; that there’s a fine balance between humour and bad taste; that not all children’s life experiences can be successfully represented in literature. As technology continues to advance, we are likely to see greater innovation and stories will be interpreted in numerous ways, providing greater choice to the audience. Despite that, reading should and must be prioritised, authors urge. “Children today engage with stories not just through print or oral storytelling but animpressivevariety of mediums. All this is very exciting, but I feel there is no substitute for the benefits reading in print provides,” said Deepa, who has covered historical fiction to fantasy, retold traditional tales to realistic fiction in her works. Zai too affirmed and shared, “I continue to say, stodgily and boringly, that there’s no substitute for a book…” Zai who wrote a little play once, shared that it was good to hear from a family that they enjoyed performing it. “Many children love to dress up and perform and there’s usually a role for even those who don’t, when a “production” is being developed. Also, as a teacher, I converted several stories such as Maupassant’sThe Necklaceinto plays, and we had a lot of fun. So, I would encourage writers to look at this genre, this possibility,” said Zai. We need more sports fiction and home-grown fantasy, Deepa feels as she stressed the need for coveringclimate change, ecology, and other issues the world is facing like children in conflict zones and displacement. “Though many excellent books have been written, theyoung adultgenre also needs more representation because exploring teenage problems in books can be a form of support at this vulnerable age. There has been an explosion in non-fiction writing but there is scope for much more,” said Deepa, whose latest bookThe Arthashastra for Children, an adaptation of Kautilya’s classic on statecraft, uses many examples from world history and contemporary situations to demonstrate his theories. “I think it is important for children to gain insights into the way governments work, or should work, outside of their textbooks. They have much greater exposure to world politics. More information books about career options, possibly through real-life stories, would also be useful,” added Deepa. These significant conversations are part of the 15th edition of Bookaroo Children’s Festival scheduled to take place November 24-25, 2023, at Sunder Nursery, Nizamuddin,Delhifrom 11 am to 4:30 pm where authors like Zai and Deepa along with many others will hold 78 sessions over two days. Talking about looking forward to the event, Deepa said Bookaroo is a major event on the calendar for both children and parents. “Meeting their favourite authors, listening to them talk about their books, and getting books signed makes it a special experience for young book lovers. Bookaroo has made an impact on children’s book publishing too because it offers a wonderful opportunity for publishers to showcase titles.” Zai, who is popular for her workSalim Mamoo and Me, addresses such events as “important spaces”, hugely enjoyed by the whole family… “and that some parents should let their kids choose books, rather than do it for them!” Children’s book publishing has come a long way. However, considering our vast population and the number of schools all over the country, book sales remain discouraging. “Children’s books by Indian authors are not marketed as actively as books for adults, because they contribute greatly in building a base of dedicated readers. This becomes demotivating for authors who invest so much of themselves into writing a book,” Deepa said. There is also the unfortunate assumption that writing a book for children is child’s play, that it is an “easier” kind of writing. “This is something that needs to change. Children’s writing must receive its due as asignificant genre,” Deepa concluded. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",

              "       'How is gargling with salt water effective?As soon as the chill in the air takes over, many resort to home remedies that start with taking herbs and spices. However, one effective remedy that works for many is salt water gargling. Have you ever wondered how it works? According to Dr Shrey Srivastav, MD (Internal Medicine), Sharda Hospital, Noida, salt water gargles are a simple, safe, and affordablehome remedy. “They’re most often used for viral respiratory infections like sore throats or sinus infections. Gargling with salt water has been shown to ease pain and inflammation from a sore throat,” said Dr Srivastav. Dr Tribhuvan Gulati, lead consultant, diabetes, obesity and internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital (R),Delhitoo agreed and mentioned that gargling with salt water is a time-tested and effective remedy for various oral and throat ailments. “The saline solution helps create an environment that is inhospitable to bacteria and viruses, making it an excellent practice for soothing sore throats and reducing inflammation. Gargles with salt water are known to remove excess fluid from inflammatory tissues, relieving pain and hastening the healing process,” said Dr Gulati. Gargling with salt water regularly might be a proactive way to maintain good dental hygiene and general health. Dr Srivastav explained that salt has been scientifically proven to help draw water out of oral tissues which creates asaltbarrier that locks out water and harmful pathogens like viruses and bacteria from getting back inside and reduces the chance of infections in the mouth and throat, and relieve inflammation in certain cases. Moreover, the osmotic effect of salt can help to break down mucus and reduce congestion in the throat. “Salt’s gentle antiseptic qualities also aid in the removal of dangerous germs, halting the progression of illnesses. This straightforward yet effective treatment is a go-to choice for easing the symptoms of colds, the flu, and other respiratory illnesses since it’s simple to make and apply,” Dr Gulati added. One can use salt water gargle forsore throat, colds, flu, sinus and respiratory infections, allergies, dental problems (Gingivitis, Periodontitis, and Cavities), and mouth ulcers. “Mix about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt to every 250 ml of warm water and gargle once or twice per day,” said Dr Srivastav. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'As employees return to office, what is the new coffee badging trend affecting work?Coffee badging, a term that has gone viral in theGenZparlance, essentially means a short visit to the office by an employee such that while spending less time at work, the person socialises with co-workers over a cup of coffee or tea, and then leaves for home. Seema Rekha, managing director, Antarmanh Consulting described it as “counterproductive” largely because employees travel back home duringoffice timings,which hampers productivity and delays service delivery. The anxiety of commuting, daily traffic and money spent on it pushes them to reduce their physical presence at work. Simultaneously, it spoils their image as well. According to Seema, from a social wellness perspective, a meaningful conversation with colleagues may makeemployeesfeel more engaged and have a better sense of belonging. However, it is taxing for leaders because they have to be in the office for longer hours to accommodate their team members. Coffee badging goes beyond being a passing trend, it represents a subtle resistance to rigid return-to-office directives, said Navneet Singh, Founder and CEO of AVSAR. “In the ever-evolving realm of hybrid work setups, this trend underscores the increasing importance of autonomy and deliberate connections. It’s not just about style; it’s about shaping a workplace where a balanced mix of flexibility and face-to-face collaboration is valued,” said Singh. According to Singh, this shift reflects a cultural change, prioritising meaningful interactions over traditional attendance measures and potentially paving the way for a new normal in the post-pandemic professional landscape. Working from the office gives space for the closure of assignments if all significant team members are present and focused on the task at hand. However, working from the office also demands more effort, long commutation, expense, and oftenlack of sleep. “It also gets frustrating if they have to connect via video tools with their other colleagues while in the office. Some disengaged employees feel worthy by ticking the checkbox. Since they are not able to demonstrate their skills at the task at hand, making a guest appearance gives them a sense of purpose,” Seema described. Due to a lack of clarity in thoughts, they keep juggling between what is right and/or wrong for their personal growth. On the other hand, task-oriented, Hi-Po(high potential) employees look for an agenda, hence they prefer closing their tasks as per their mental timeline. “They compare their productivity during work from home to work from office. They just go to the office to mark their presence and feel productive by balancing their work and social life at work,” said Seema. The positives of coffee badging could be social well-being, networking, and a sense of belonging – as co-workers spend a lot of time together. However poor productivity and pending work are the obvious cons ofcoffee badging. “A consistent unsettling feeling of being distracted by the time clock often causes an inability to finish the task,” expressed Seema. Managers have to create a conscious mapping for their team members, and then a plan for highly productive outcomes in hybrid systems. Seema explained that rostering is no longer a workforce management team’s task and the operations team has to deep dive into it. “They have to keep various parameters such as the potential of employees, the criticality of project life cycle and delivery, and the prioritisation of tasks in their minds while curating the plan. This is quite an effort toidentifycritical team members, their engagement, motivation, willingness, intentions, and what the future holds for them. This should be followed by stakeholder prioritisation,” said Seema. Measures to help, according to Singh Outcome-based Performance Evaluation – Focus on evaluating employees based on their actual contributions and outcomes rather than mere physical presence. – Emphasise the importance of delivering results and meeting objectives, whether working remotely or in the office. Flexible Work Policies – Establish clear and flexible remote work policies that accommodate various work styles.– Encourage a balance between in-person andremote workbased on job requirements and individual preferences. Technology for Collaboration – Utilise collaboration tools and technology to ensure effective communication and teamwork regardless of physical location.– Create a virtual environment that fosters interaction, making it inclusive for both in-office and remote employees. Regular Team Engagement – Implement regular team meetings, whether virtual or in-person, to maintain a sense of connection and collaboration.– Promote team-building activities that transcend physical office boundaries. 5. Emphasis on Contribution – Shift the focus of workplace culture towards recognising and rewardingemployeesfor their meaningful contributions, irrespective of where the work is done.– Discourage a culture solely centered on presenteeism. 6. Open Communication – Foster open communication channels where employees feel comfortable expressing their preferences regarding work arrangements. – Encourage dialogue on what truly contributes to a positive and productive work environment. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Can you get sick because of your pillow?Your pillow, often a silent partner in your nightly rest, can influence your health in unexpected ways. The relationship between your pillow and your well-being may not be immediately apparent, but it is undeniably significant. The choice ofpillowcan impact your sleep quality, which, in turn, affects your immune system, mental health, and overall vitality. While yourpillowmay not directly make you sick, it can contribute to physical discomfort and issues. Most people prefer to sleep on their sides, and this necessitates using a pillow of the appropriate height to fill the gap between the mattress and support the head. Failing to use the right pillow can result in an unsupported head that leans or bends downward, potentially causing neck pain, giddiness, and even pain and numbness in the upper limbs, explained Dr R H Chauhan, orthopedic surgeon, Bhatia HospitalMumbai. Even if you sleep on your back, using a pillow is important to maintain the natural curvature of the cervical spine. “However, using extra-thick pillows can lead to discomfort, neck pain, and even numbness and weakness in the upper limbs. These effects are primarily due to the abnormal positioning of the cervical spine, which can disrupt your overall comfort and well-being,” Dr Chauhan toldindianexpress.com. If experts are to go by, in addition to improper neck and spine support from an ill-fitting pillow, it can accumulate dust mites, allergens, or even mould which can trigger allergies, asthma, or respiratory issues, leading to repeated sickness, said Dr Shwetal Gadhavi, senior consultant,preventive healthcare, HCG Hospitals,Ahmedabad. What can be done? Dr Chauhan emphasised that choosing the right pillow that suits yoursleeping positionis crucial for a good night’s sleep and for preventing potential health problems, such as giddiness and the risk of falls and related injuries. How to go about selecting the right pillow? Opt for a pillow that offers proper neck and spine support, aligning with your body’s natural contours. “Memory foam, latex, and feather pillows are popular choices that cater to various preferences. It’s essential to test a pillow’s comfort before purchase, ensuring it’s the perfect fit for you,” said Dr Gadhavi. To keep your pillow in optimal condition and reduce health risks, wash your pillowcase every 1-2 weeks, and the pillow itself every 3-6 months, depending on usage, mentioned Dr Gadhavi. “Follow the manufacturer’s care instructions to preserve its quality. Some pillows are machine-washable, while others require spot cleaning,” said Dr Gadhavi. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Oil-rich food and alcohol can cause adult acne; here’s howHave pimples become your BFFs post the past week of festivities? Thanks to all the oil-rich food and alcohol you guzzled at Diwali parties, not only does your wallet have a crater-sized hole but your face does too. In multiples, we’re guessing. Dr Bhavana Nukala, consultant dermatologist, CARE Hospitals, tellsindianexpress.comin an interaction that diets high in saturated and trans fats\\xa0may contribute toacne.“These fats can increase sebum production in the skin, leading to clogged pores and acne. Foods like fried foods, processed snacks, and certain cooking oils may fall into this category.” She added that alcohol may have inflammatory effects on the skin, exacerbating existing acne or causing new breakouts. Additionally, alcohol is also a diuretic, which can bring about excessivedehydration of your skin, if consumed at high levels. Though, there is no specific quantity that universally defines “too much” alcohol, maintaining a balanced diet and moderating alcohol intake can contribute to overall skin health, said Dr Nakula. Cleanse your skin: Use a mild cleanser to remove excess oil, dirt, and makeup. Avoid harsh scrubbing, as it can irritate the skin and worsen acne. Moisturise well:Even if you have oily skin, moisturising is essential to maintain skin hydration. Use non-comedogenic products:Select skincare and makeup products labeled as non-comedogenic, meaning they won’t clog pores. Healthy diet:Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Include foods high in omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fish, flaxseeds) as they have anti-inflammatory properties to combat the inflammation from alcohol. Hydration: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin and body well-hydrated. Limit alcohol and oil-rich foods:Moderation is key. Reduce alcohol intake and limit the consumption of foods high in saturated and trans fats. Avoid touching your face:Touching your face can transfer bacteria and irritate the skin, leading to breakouts. If acne persists, seek professional advice. Dermatologists can recommend specific treatments such as topical or oral medications, chemical peels, or laser therapy. Dr Nakula noted that individual responses to dietary changes and skincare routines can vary. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Are you still feeling the post-festive blues? Here’s some helpWith the excitement of thefestive seasoncoming to an end, you may find yourself grappling with a peculiar emotional phenomenon — post-festival blues. Now that normalcy has set in after the vibrant festive season, people may experience a sense of dullness as they return to the slow pace of life. Also known as a festival comedown, Dr Jyoti Kapoor, founder-director and senior psychiatrist, Manasthali, explains that post-festival blues refers to thefeeling of sadness, letdown, or even “depression” that some individuals experience after attending a festival or a major event. “Festivals are often characterised by high energy, excitement, social interactions, and a sense of community. However, when the event comes to an end, attendees may feel a noticeable contrast between the intense, positive experiences of the festival and the return to their regular, everyday lives,” she said. While post-festival blues is not a psychiatric disorder, Dr Shaunak Ajinkya, consultant, psychiatrist, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital,Mumbaisaid that this transient emotional state can be overwhelming and persist even for weeks. *Social withdrawal:Festivals often provide a strong sense of community and social connection. When the event concludes, attendees may find themselves returning to a more isolated or less stimulating social environment. *Loss of excitement:The vibrant atmosphere, pulsating music, and immersive entertainment that define festivals create a sensory overload. The absence of these stimuli post-festival can lead to asense of emptinessor boredom. *Return to routine:The transition from a carefree, celebratory environment to the routine and responsibilities of everyday life can be challenging for some people. The contrast can intensify feelings of post-festival blues. *Anticipation buildup:The anticipation leading up to a festival can be a powerful emotional experience. When the event ends, there may be a letdown as the excitement and anticipation fade away. *Emotional exhaustion:The sensory overload and intensity of emotions experienced during a festival can contribute to emotional exhaustion. After the event, individuals may feel drained and emotionally depleted. It’s normal to feel a bit let down after festivals, according to Kamna Chhibber, clinical psychologist, head- mental health, Department of Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences, Fortis Healthcare. However, taking proactive steps to take care of your well-being and maintaining a positive outlook can help ease the transition back to everyday life. Here are some strategies to help you beat the post-festival blues. *Reflect on the positive moments:Recall memorable moments, performances, and connections you made. Focus on the positive energy and experiences rather than dwelling on the fact that the festival has ended. *Stay connected:Keep in touch with friends or people you met during the festival.Social connectionscan help maintain a sense of community and provide ongoing support. Share photos, memories, and experiences with others to prolong the positive feelings. *Ease back into routine:Gradually reintegrate into your routine rather than making abrupt changes. This can help ease the transition and minimise the shock of returning to normalcy. *Plan future events:Give yourself something to look forward to by planning future events, whether they are small gatherings, concerts, or other activities. Having upcoming plans can help shift your focus away from the post-festival blues. *Practice self-care:Get enough sleep, eat healthy, stay away from addictive substances and engage in activities that bring you comfort.

              "       'Pilates girls: Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan give us fitness goals with this ‘flowing’ practiceTrust the best of buddiesJanhvi Kapoorand Sara Ali Khan to give us some major FOMO fitness goals. The duo who loves toworkouttogether withPilatestrainer Namrata Purohit were seen practising some moves with Purohit. “Going with the flow…it was a flowing kind of day yesterday,” said Purohit on her Instagram. She mentioned that the duo was seen doing friction training… “Really activating the entire body and the fascia too”. “My #PilatesGirls@janhvikapoor and @saraalikhan95 burning it up,” she added. Taking a cue, we decided to explore more about the practice. Friction training workouts are a form of exercise that incorporates intentional challenges and obstacles to enhance physical and mental conditioning. The term friction in this context symbolises the resistance or difficulties encountered during theworkout, creating a dynamic and engaging training experience. “This approach is designed to go beyond traditional exercise routines, pushing individuals to develop a broader set of skills, including strength, agility, problem-solving, and adaptability,” explained fitness expert Garima Goyal. In a friction training workout, the environment plays a crucial role. Unlike conventional workouts in a controlled setting, friction training often takes place in varied and unpredictable surroundings. This could involve outdoor terrains with natural obstacles, urban environments with structures to navigate, or specially designed courses that simulate challenging scenarios. According to Goyal, one common element of friction training is the incorporation of functional movements. Exercises mimic real-life activities, emphasising the integration ofmultiple musclegroups and promoting a holistic approach to fitness. “This might include lifting, carrying, crawling, jumping, and climbing, all designed to enhance overall strength, flexibility, and coordination,” said Goyal. Fitness props like sandbags,kettlebells, and battle ropes can be incorporated to increase the intensity of exercises and simulate the demands of real-world activities. “The irregular shapes and dynamic nature of these objects engage stabilising muscles and improve overall functional strength,” Goyal mentioned. Friction trainingalso frequently incorporates elements of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Goyal noted that short bursts of intense effort followed by brief periods of rest challenge cardiovascular fitness and contribute to the overall effectiveness of the workout. “This combination of strength training, agility exercises, and cardiovascular conditioning creates a well-rounded and efficient approach to fitness,” said Goyal. Safety is paramount in friction training. Participants are encouraged to focus on proper form and technique to minimise the risk of injury. Trainers play a crucial role in guiding individuals through the challenges, ensuring thatexercisesare performed safely and effectively. Performing a friction training workout properly involves a combination of careful planning, attention to form, and an understanding of the principles behind this dynamic form of exercise. *Understand the basics –Familiarise yourself with the principles of friction training, which often involves functional movements, varied environments, and intentional challenges.*Warm-up –Begin with a thorough warm-up to prepare your muscles and joints for the dynamic movements ahead. Include activities that increase heart rate, like light jogging or jumping jacks, and dynamic stretches to improve flexibility. *Choose or design a friction workout –Select or design a workout that aligns with your fitness level and goals. This might involve obstacle courses,functional movements, or a combination of both. Ensure the workout includes a mix of strength training, cardiovascular exercises, and challenges that engage both body and mind.

              "       'Kitchen 101: Ditch plastic chopping boards nowCutting boardsare one of the most commonly seen tools in the majority of households and restaurants. With continued use during food preparation like slicing, and chopping, they tend to wear down and show slash marks. These vary depending on whether such cutting boards are made up of rubber, bamboo, wood, or plastic. As such, research indicates that certainplastic materialsused in boards, including polypropylene and polyethylene, can “shed nano-and micro-sized flecks when cut with knives”, according to a May 2023Environmental Science & Technologystudy published inPubMed. “Plastic chopping boards are identified as a substantial source of microplastics in human food, which requires careful attention,” it read. Plastic cutting boardshave raised concerns due to potential health hazards associated with the release of microplastics. As these boards age and wear down through use, tiny plastic particles, known as microplastics, can break off and contaminate food. “Research indicates that these microplastics can leach harmful chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, into the food being prepared,” warned Dr Kaushal Kishor Yadav, senior consultant and clinical lead – Surgical Oncology, Narayana Hospital, Gurugram. The grooves and scratches on these boards, though seemingly harmless, create an ideal breeding ground for bacteria that can withstand typical cleaning methods. “Additionally, microplastics—tiny plastic particles measuring less than 5 millimeters—have discreetly entered both our environment and food chain,” said Manvi Lohia, MPH, RD, head of holistic health, and international business at Ekaanta. According to Lohia, even thorough scrubbing with hot water and soap may prove insufficient to eliminate these concealed microbial residents. While many plastic cutting boards are labelled as dishwasher safe, high temperatures in dishwashers can cause them to warp and develop more grooves, providing additional spaces for bacteria to hide, added holistic coach Dr Mickey Mehta. The above-mentioned study compared five people’s chopping patterns and one person’s chopping on different materials with and without carrots. “From the results, the team calculated that food preparation could produce 14 to 71 million polyethylene microplastics and 79 million polypropylene microplastics from their respective boards each year. The estimates could vary, depending on the individual’s chopping style; the board material; the force needed to cut through foods; whether ingredients are roughly or finely chopped, and how often a cutting board is used. “Studies have linked exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in plastics to various health issues, such as hormonal imbalances and developmental problems. Moreover, once consumed, these microplastics may accumulate in the body over time, with long-term implications that are not yet fully understood,” said Dr Yadav. In a 2019 study by the environmental charity WWF International, one may be ingesting five grams a week, the equivalent of eating a credit card. Yet another study showed plastic cutting boards release 15 mgmicroplasticsper cut, totalling 50 g annually which is like 10 plastic credit cards. To mitigate theseconcerns, some advocate for using alternative materials like wooden or bamboo cutting boards. According to Dr Yadav, these materials are believed to be less prone to producing harmful microplastics. “Additionally, regular maintenance and replacing plastic cutting boards when they show signs of wear can help reduce the risk of contamination. Overall, while convenient, plastic cutting boards necessitate careful consideration to minimise potential health risks associated with microplastic exposure,” said Dr Yadav. Lohia also feels that, despite their affordability and durability, plastic cutting boards harbour dangerous bacteria and pose a risk ofcross-contaminationduring meat preparation. “To ensure culinary safety, I suggest individuals opt for wood or bamboo boards, known for their resilience against bacteria. Your kitchen choices are pivotal in safeguarding health, transforming it into a heaven of culinary delight without compromising safety,” Lohia said.

              "       'This is why you wake up with anxiety in the morningAre you someone who feels heavy in your heart or head as soon as you wake up? Do you experience racing thoughts or overwhelming feelings before you even get out of bed? While some stress is considered a natural part of life, excessive worrying about everyday tasks or situations that others see as non-threatening can indicate an anxiety disorder, according to Jasreen Birgi, associate city lead at mental health startup Lissun. A Lancet study in 2021 reported a 35% rise in anxiety disorders in India during the pandemic. The study also found that women and younger people were highly impacted by anxiety and depression as compared to men and senior citizens. Similar findings were reported by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) data published in 2020. The data reported that almost 9.3 % of India’s youth between the ages 18 to 24 years suffered from either anxiety or depression during the early days of the pandemic, this number increased to 16.8 % by March 2022. Thereportalso suggests that more women were impacted by anxiety and depression as compared to men. Birgi explained that everyone feels anxious sometimes, and anxiety is a natural response to stress. For example, you might feel anxious just after waking up because of a job interview or an exam at school. However, if your morning anxiety starts to feel out of your control, it may be a sign of a deeper problem. Biological causes:Cortisol, often known as “stress hormone” due to its role in controlling the body’s fight-or-flight response to stress. It is highest during the hour after you wake up. Cortisol awakening response (CAR), is a phenomena which is especially common among people who regularly experience anxiety. Anxiety disorders:Morning anxiety may be a sign of an anxiety disorder, such as generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD experience excessive worry and fear for at least six months. Other symptoms may include chronic fatigue, problems with focus, and restlessness. Poor sleep quality:Sleep issues like Insomnia, disrupted sleep, and poor sleep quality may make one feel more anxious in the morning. Some studies have found that a lower sleep time each night is linked to increased morning anxiety levels. Sugar & Caffeine Intake:What we eat affects how we feel.Few research have connected anxiety to higher sugar intake. Other studies have found a link between hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Research also suggests that heavy caffeine intake is associated with higher anxiety levels. Substance or alcohol use:Alcohol and substance misuse can cause people to feel anxious upon waking. Research shows that cocaine/alcohol/other drugs use can also worsen anxiety symptoms and increase the risk of an anxiety disorder. Physical health issues:Chronic physical illness can contribute toa person feeling more anxious. Although everyone will respond to health conditions differently, a person with an ongoing medical issue may develop health anxiety. Life Stressors:Major life changes can cause anxiety issues. Like: changes in living arrangements, such as moving to a new area or someone else moving out changes in employment, such as switching jobs or losing a job, experiencing physical, mental, or sexual abuse, the separation from or death of a loved one, emotional shock after a traumatic event relationship trouble, financial worries, etc. Genes and Anxiety:Few people are prone to feel anxious. A 2017 review of studies showed that generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can be inherited, with GAD and associated conditions being linked to a number of different genes. Most researchers conclude that anxiety is genetic but can also be influenced by environmental factors. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Why hugging is important for your mental and physical healthHugs, those warm, comforting gestures of affection, have a profound impact on our well-being. Beyond their ability to convey love and connection, hugging is a powerful tool that can significantly benefit both mental and physical health. From reducing stress to promoting emotional connection and even enhancing physical health, hugging is an essential aspect of our lives. We explore whyhugging is importantfor our overall well-being and how it can enhance our lives in various ways. Mehezabin Dordi, clinical psychologist, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, explained that hugging triggers the release of oxytocin, often referred to as the “love hormone” or “bonding hormone.” “It plays a crucial role in social bonding, attachment, and emotional regulation. The increase in oxytocin levels promotes feelings of trust, empathy, and attachment to the person hugging us.” She added that hugging can activate the brain’s reward centres, particularly the ventral striatum. “This is the area of the brain associated with pleasure and reward. It reinforces the positive experience of the hug and encourages individuals to seek out social interactions and physical closeness.” Here’s why hugging matters for your physical and mental health. i. Pain Relief:Physical touch, like massage or even a simple hug, can stimulate the release of endorphins, which are natural painkillers. It can help reduce the perception of pain and alleviate discomfort. ii. Stress Reduction:Touch triggers the release of oxytocin, a hormone that can lower cortisol levels and reduce stress. Chronic stress is linked to various health issues, so reducing stress through touch can have long-term health benefits. iii. Immune System Boost:Research suggests that positive physical interactions, such as hugging, can strengthen the immune system. The reduction in stress and the release of oxytocin may play a role in improving immune function. iv. Heart Health:Physical touch, especially hugging, can lead to a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Over time, this can contribute to better cardiovascular health. i. Mood Improvement:Physical touch, including hugging, stimulates the release of endorphins, which can elevate mood and create feelings of happiness and well-being. It’s a natural mood enhancer. ii. Anxiety and Depression Reduction:Hugging and physical touch can provide comfort and emotional support. This can be particularly valuable in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, as it fosters a sense of connection and security. iii. Emotional Connection:Touch is a powerful means of non-verbal communication. It can convey emotions like love, empathy, and understanding, which are essential for building and maintaining relationships. Strong social connections are closely tied to emotional well-being. iv. Stress Management: Regular physical touch can act as a stress management tool. It helps regulate the body’s stress response, making it easier to cope with the challenges of daily life and reducing the long-term impact of chronic stress on emotional health. Other than hugging your friends and family, don’t forget the therapeutic power of cuddling with your furry friends. The love you share with your pets is equally meaningful. Remember that self-hugs count too. Embrace yourself with self-compassion and self-love. It can have a soothing effect, especially during moments of self-doubt or anxiety. So, the next time you have the opportunity, share a warm embrace with someone you care about, and feel the profound impact it can have on your life. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",

              "       'Why are sustainable fashion products so expensive?Remember that dustingkapdain your kitchen? Yeah, the one that used to be your dad’s shirt and then went on to become your younger brother’s shirt before it began a new life as that dusting cloth. Indians have a fascinating relationship withsustainabilitywhen it comes to fashion. We’ve long converted our old clothes to dustingkapdas, pochasor passed them on to our younger siblings. Although the meaning of sustainable clothes in the modern fashion stratosphere means clothes that are made with materials that are not harmful to the environment, sustainability is more of a vibe, as Gen Z would say. While they are distinct, slow fashion and sustainable fashion are frequently used interchangeably. Sustainability, as a whole, in fashion is a movement and approach to fashion that emphasises quality and longevity. According to Shivani, founder of her eponymous label Shivanii, it encourages consumers to buy fewer items of higher quality that are ethically produced and have a longer lifespan. She explained that slow fashion is a specific subset within sustainable fashion, emphasising a slower pace of production and consumption as a means to achieve the said sustainability. If you have you been wanting tomake the switch to sustainable fashion, you might have wondered why most products made under that label are more expensive than your usual clothes. There are several reasons. A. Manufacturing capacity Fashion designer Shilpi Gupta tellsindianexpress.comthat because it is manufactured in small quantities to indicate its exclusivity and uses premium fabrics and materials, sustainable fashion is often pricey. “When a product is produced in large quantities, the cost per unit is lower than when it is produced in smaller batches. Slow fashion clothing is pricey because creative solutions and materials are more expensive than standard ones.” B. Quality of the clothes used Deepa Goel, founder of Siddh Couture, explained that\\xa0focus of sustainable fashion is on the quality of craftsmanship and construction. Anurag Saboo, co-founder of DaMENSCH, agreed, saying that “the endeavour to create a product that lasts multiple uses and seasons is what defines the product creation for slow fashion.” C. Fair wages Ensuring ethical labour practices also drives the price up, said Shivani. “Transparency in the supply chain and fair wages for workers are important. Ultimately, slow fashion pricing reflects the true cost of creating a responsibly produced,high-quality garment.” But this does not mean that thethappa (imprint)of sustainability hasn’t been misused. It was last year in July that a lawsuit was filed against Swedish fast-fashion giant Hennes and Maurtiz, better known as H&M, in a New York federal court, accusing it of “greenwashing” or engaging in false advertising about the sustainability of its clothing that was marketed as “conscious.” Chelsea Commodore, a marketing student at SUNY New Paltz, initiated the lawsuit claiming she overpaid for a fashion item marketed as “conscious,” which, according to her allegations, did not align with its advertised sustainability. She contended that several products from the brand’s Conscious Collection, promoted as utilising less water in manufacturing, actually consume more water. H&M attributed the discrepancy to technical issues. While the legal action revolves around the pricing of the garment, the allegations within the lawsuit encompass a comprehensive critique of the global fashion industry and its failure to fulfill promises of reform. These include the use of ambiguous terms like “close the loop” and “a conscious choice,” labeling products as “sustainable.” Most significantly, the lawsuit underscores the exploitation of collective climate guilt to justify charging higher prices for ostensibly similar-quality clothing. But does this mean you stop buying sustainable clothing or indulging in the larger conversations about slow fashion? Especially because the same cannot be said about smaller, home-grown brands who are pushing the envelope when it comes to this. The need is to be more careful in analysing what makes a garment sustainable and how transparent are the policies of the company making it. The Higg Index of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, which has members like Amazon and Reformation, provides scorecards revealing the average impact of various materials, including leather, linen, and PVC. These scorecards quantify factors such as water use, water pollution, fossil-fuel use, chemical use, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with each material. While buying sustainable products, Gupta recommended taking into considerationpurchasing classic and long-lasting items. “Avoid following the trends.” Saboo suggested using the the price per wear metric to make your buying decisions while Shivani advised exploring second-hand and vintage stores for unique finds. And finally taking good care of these pieces is just as important, said Deepa, so they can be used multiple times over the years, making them a beautiful asset in your wardrobe for generations. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Can you guess Katrina Kaif’s favourite foods?We all make a face with vegetables like turai or ridge gourd, or even gobhi or cauliflower. But did you know that these are some ofTigeractorKatrina Kaif‘s favourite foods? Well, we were in surprise too as she listed down the same along with another healthy appetiser on her Instagram Stories as part of anAsk-Me-Anything session. In response to one user’s question, she shared, “Turai ki subzi, gobhi ki subzi, and broccoli soup”. Intrigued byKaif‘s choices, we decided to understand how such foods help. Clinical dietitian Garima Goyal said that ridge gourd is low in calories. “This makes turai ki subzi a great option for individuals aiming to maintain or lose weight, as it providesnutrientswithout contributing significantly to daily caloric intake. The fibre content aids in digestion by promoting regular bowel movements, preventing constipation, and supporting a healthy digestive system,” said Goyal. Goyal also mentioned thatvitamins and minerals(A and C) are crucial for maintaining healthy vision, skin, and the immune system. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, supporting the immune system and promoting skin health. “The high water content in ridge gourd contributes to overall hydration, which is essential for various bodily functions, including temperature regulation and nutrient transport,” Goyal said. Cauliflower is a nutritional powerhouse, providing a wide range of vitamins and minerals essential for overall health. Vitamin C supports the immune system, while vitamin K is crucial for blood clotting and bone health. “For those focusing on weight management or following a low-calorie diet, cauliflower is an excellent choice. It’s low in calories and carbohydrates, making it a filling option without contributing significantly todaily caloric intake,” said Goyal. According to Goyal, the fibre in cauliflower aids in digestion by promoting regular bowel movements, preventing constipation, and supporting a healthy digestive system. This can contribute to a feeling of fullness and help with weight management. Goyal also mentioned that the antioxidants in cauliflower, including glucosinolates and carotenoids, help neutralise free radicals. This may contribute to reducing oxidative stress in the body and lowering the risk of chronic diseases. Versatility in cooking – Cauliflower’s neutral flavour and versatile texture make it a valuable ingredient in various dishes. It can be used as a low-carb substitute for rice, mashed potatoes, or even pizza crust, offering a healthier option in many recipes. Soups are often easier to digest, and the cooking process can break down cell walls in vegetables, making the nutrients more accessible to the body. Broccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable, and when used in soup, it retains many of its essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin K, folate, and potassium. “Broccoli contains antioxidants, such as sulforaphane and quercetin, which help neutralise free radicals in the body, potentially reducing oxidative stress and therisk of chronic diseases,” said Goyal. Broccoli soup can be a filling and low-calorie option for those aiming to manage their weight. “The fibre content contributes to a sense of fullness, potentially reducing overall calorie intake,” said Goyal. The expert explained that vitamin C in broccoli is known for its immune-boosting properties, contributing to the body’s defense against infections and illnesses. “Broccoli soup can be heart-healthy due to its fibre content, which helps lower cholesterol levels. Additionally, the presence of sulforaphane may have cardiovascular benefits,” said Goyal. What more? Broccoli is a good source ofvitamin Kand calcium, both important for bone health. Including broccoli soup in your diet may contribute to maintaining strong and healthy bones, mentioned Goyal. Broccoli soupis versatile and can be adapted to various tastes. It can include additional nutritious ingredients like carrots, onions, and garlic, enhancing both flavour and nutritional content. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",

              "       'Is it a good idea to do DIY derma hacking at home?In the ever-evolving landscape of skincare, a new trend has emerged—derma hacking. This practice involves DIY (Do It Yourself) approaches to skincare procedures traditionally performed in professional settings, such as dermatology clinics or spas. Dr Swapna Priya, dermatologist, CARE Hospitals, explained that the primary objective of derma hacking is to trigger the production of collagen and elastin, essential proteins for skin health and elasticity, leading to an overallimprovement in skin appearance. She noted that some prevalent derma hacking techniques include: From microneedling at home to crafting personalised skincare concoctions, derma hacking has gained popularity, but the safety and efficacy of such practices remain under scrutiny. Dr Rinky Kapoor, dermatologist and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, warned that without a clear definition of derma hacking, it is challenging to outline specific benefits or risks. “Professional dermatological treatments often have established benefits but also potential side effects.” She noted that safety depends on the specific techniques and products involved. “Always consult with a qualified dermatologist or healthcare professional before trying anynew skin procedures,” Dr Kapoor added. While derma hacking can be safe under the supervision of a trained professional, according to Dr Priya, engaging in these procedures at home without proper training or equipment poses certain risks. Potential risks associated with derma hacking include: “It’s crucial to recognise that the safety of derma hacking varies based on individual skin types and the specific technique employed,” Dr Priya toldindianexpress.com Derma hacking is not advisable forindividuals with these issues, according to Dr Priya. – Active infections– Eczema– Psoriasis– Rosacea– Active acne– Bleeding disorders– Pregnancy–Cancer Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential before undergoing derma hacking, particularly if there are underlying health conditions or if the individual is taking medications. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Your gym clothes could be leaching chemicals; experts weigh inWho hasn’t sweat through their yoga pants and t-shirts while burning the midnight oil on that monstrous treadmill? Hitting the gym is a fantastic way to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but have you ever considered the potential risks hidden in your workout routine? While you’re sweating it out in those trendy gym clothes, you might be unaware that they could be harbouring a hidden danger. Gym clothes, primarily synthetic activewear, may contain chemicals that can leach onto your skin, raising concerns about the impact on your health. New research conducted by the University of Birmingham in October 2023, also pointed to this. Dr B Shilpa Naidu, internal medicine, Manipal Hospitals, explained that while working out at the gym, we tend to sweat profusely, and this sweat often contains natural oils. “These oils possess chemical properties that facilitate the dissolution and diffusion of chemicals found in plastic materials, leading to the potential leaching of these chemicals into our bodies when we come into contact with plastic.” In essence, the oily substances in our sweat play a role in releasing harmful chemicals from themicroplastic fiberspresent in our gym clothing. These chemicals can then become available for absorption by the human body, potentially resulting in various adverse health effects, including thyroid diseases, disruptions in hormonal balance, and neurological issues. Dr Swapna Priya, dermatologist, CARE Hospitals, noted that these chemicals can be present in the fabric itself, as well as in the dyes, finishes, and other additives used during production. In the past, exposure to plastic chemicals primarily occurred through the consumption of plastic-contaminated food and beverages. However, it’s now widely recognised that humans can also be exposed to these chemicals through their skin. Dr Naidu explained that the concern stems from the fact that the harmful chemicals present in plastics tend to bioaccumulate over time, gradually building up in our bodies and persisting there. Skin irritation Allergies and respiratory issues:Certain chemicals may trigger allergic reactions or respiratory problems in susceptible individuals. Endocrine disruption:Some toxic chemicals can disrupt the endocrine system, potentially leading to hormonal imbalances and long-term health issues. Carcinogens:In some cases, the chemicals used in gym clothes can be carcinogenic, increasing the risk ofcancerwith prolonged exposure, Dr Swapna said. Choose natural and organic materials A simple and effective method to reduce exposure to these chemicals is to opt for clothing made from sustainably produced, minimally processed natural textiles that don’t contain the toxins associated with plastic materials. Check for certifications Look for clothing with certifications like Oeko-Tex Standard 100 or GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) to ensure they meet certain environmental and safety standards. The doctors suggested checking fabric labels and looking for items primarily comprising organic cotton, hemp, or merino wool. “These natural textiles are less likely to contain harmful plastic-related chemicals and provide a safer and eco-friendly choice for your wardrobe,” said Dr Naidu. Avoid clothing with antimicrobial claims Be cautious about gym clothes that claim to have antimicrobial properties, as they may contain harmful substances, said Dr Swapna. Wash your gym clothes properly Follow care instructions for your gym clothes, use mild detergents, and avoid excessive use of fabric softeners and bleach. Ventilate your gym bag Ensure your gym bag is well-ventilated to prevent the buildup of odours and moisture, which can exacerbate chemical leaching. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'Here’s how to quieten your mind using the Japanese concept of MaIn the fast-paced world we inhabit, where constant noise and chaos often define our daily lives, finding moments of tranquillity has become a sought-after luxury. Enterthe Japanese conceptof Ma, a profound principle rooted in the art of space, silence, and the pauses between actions. While it may seem counterintuitive in a society that often glorifies busyness, incorporating the philosophy of Ma into your life can significantly enhance mental well-being. Derived from the Japanese character for “gap” or “space,” Ma goes beyond its literal definition. It embodies the notion of creating a harmonious balance between elements, allowing for a pause or interval that is as crucial as the activities themselves. Dr Shaunak Ajinkya, psychiatrist, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani HospitalMumbai, explained that Ma is vital for personal growth as it emphasises balance, mindfulness, and an appreciation of the transitions in life. “Embracing the pauses in life without feeling a sense of unease or boredom, cultivates patience, resilience, and a deeper connection with one inner self,” he tellsindianexpress.com. Embracing nothingness encourages people to be open to new perspectives, leading to greater creativity, and a better capacity to adapt, said Dr Ajinkya. It also acts as a way of self-discovery, encouraging us to release our prejudices, he added. In a world saturated with noise, the concept of silence might be perceived as an absence, but in the realm of Ma, it is a powerful presence. Embracing moments of quietness provides a mental sanctuary, allowing the mind torest and rejuvenate. Ma invites individuals to engage in mindful reflection, fostering a deeper connection with one’s thoughts and emotions. By intentionally creating pauses in our daily routines, we enable ourselves to process experiences, gain clarity, and developa heightened awareness of our mental and emotional states. Contrary to the belief that constant activity boosts productivity, the Japanese concept of Ma suggests that purposeful pauses can be instrumental in fostering creativity. Allowing the mind to wander during moments of silence often leads to innovative ideas and solutions. By incorporating Ma into our work and personal lives, we create a conducive environment for inspiration and heightened cognitive functioning. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",
              "       'What to keep in mind when having fruits?We love to have our share offruitsfor the day. But have you ever wondered whether there is a correct way of having fruits especially when you are sick or transitioning toward winter? Ayurvedic practitioner Nidhi Pandya’s guide to having fruits is something we came across and decided to understand more about. “Do you love fruit? Not more than me. I am the ultimatefruitlover. But I have changed up my fruit game in the last 10 years. And it’s COMPLETELY changed my body,” said Nidhi in a post on Instagram. According to her, there are certain ‘rules’ to havingfruits. *Do not overload yourself with fruit. Every fruit behaves differently. Have 1-2 compatible fruits at a time. *Fruit ferments faster. Eat fruit by itself. *Eat uncooked fruit between 10.30 am to 3.30 pm. Use the energy of the sun to cook your food so that it doesn’t make a wet pool inside. So, no fruit forbreakfast. *No raw fruits in the winter. So stew and add cinnamon. *Not all fruits are equal. Pick wisely. Two fruits can be as different in their nutritional content as rice and wheat. *No fruits when sick. “Especially during a fever or cold, your agni isn’t at par,” said Nidhi. However, pomegranates can be eaten by anyone, anytime even when you are sick. But melons are the trickiest with all types to be eaten by themselves. Having fruits in between meals is always better as it allows for better nutrition absorption, said Pavithra N Raj, chief dietitian, Manipal Hospital, Yeshwanthpur,Bangalore. “Fruits have a good amount of fibre, which means combining and having it along withmealsis not advised. Also, fruits have micronutrients; so, when combined and eaten along with meals, nutrition absorption may not happen to the fullest,” Pavithra said. – Astringent fruits: apples, berries, cherries, and pear– Sweet fruits: Papaya, mango banana, peach, and avocado– Sour fruits: Orange, lemon, tangerine, andgrapefruits   A post shared by Nidhi Pandya (@my_ayurvedic_life) The expert emphasised thatcombining fruitsmay cause some digestion and bloating problems. “Eating one fruit at a time is always good because each fruit is different in nature — some are citrus, some are carbohydrate-rich and some others are vitamin and potassium-rich,” said Pavithra. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",

              "       'Why do couples divorce after decades of marriage?For the longest time, marriage has been considered sacrosanct — a lifelong commitment, especially in a country like India where matrimony is viewed as convergence of not just two individuals but two families. However, with the rising complexities of modern life, thedivorcerate in India has been steadily increasing year by year. Despite having the lowest divorce rate globally — estimated to be around 1.1% — in the past few years, India has witnessed a rise in divorce cases, according to a report by United Nations. This trend is even more prominent for couples who have been in long-term marriages of 20 years and more. While the causes of divorce differ from relationship to relationship, most couples struggle with similar issues that lead to the breakdown of their marriage. From irreconcilable differences, to changing societal norms to people growing apart, the reasons for divorce are diverse and complex. Here are some reasons why people split up after decades of marriage: In the past, larger families with more defined roles for spouses often provided a sense of structure and interdependence that helped couples weather challenges and stay together. “However, with the rise of smaller nuclear families and more egalitarian relationships, couples may face greater pressure to juggle individual needs and aspirations while maintaining a strong marital bond,” says Dr Ashima Ranjan, consultant of psychiatry, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospitals. As children leave the home and couples enter theempty nest phase, they may find themselves rediscovering each other and facing new challenges. “Couples may find that they no longer have a shared focus or common goals. While this period of transition can be a time for growth and renewal, it can also strain relationships if couples have not nurtured their connection or adapted to their changing roles,” explains Dr Jyoti Kapoor, founder-director and senior psychiatrist, Manasthali. Whileinfidelitycan be a factor for divorce at any age, its occurrence seems to be more common in longer-term marriages. “This may be due in part to the greater opportunities for connection and temptation that exist in today’s interconnected world,” Dr Ranjan notes. As life expectancy has increased, people may find themselves wanting to make the most of their remaining years. This means as people age, their priorities may shift. According to Dr Ranjan, couples may find that they have grown apart or that their individual needs and goals have diverged significantly. “Some may reevaluate what they want from life and relationships, leading to the realisation that they want something different from what their currentmarriageprovides,” says Dr Kapoor. When there are too many differences or problems that can’t be worked out, the marriage may break down. “Long-standing issues orunresolved conflicts in a marriagemay become more pronounced over time,” says Dr Kapoor. A significant contributor to the rising divorce rates is the remarkable growth of Indian women in recent years — both financially and socially. “Societal attitudes toward divorce have shifted over time, making it more socially acceptable for individuals,” says Dr Kapoor. For those on the brink of divorce, there is hope. Seeking individual and couples’ counselling can not onlysave the marriagebut also elevate it to new heights. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!',\n",

              "       'JEE Main 2024: When should I start giving mock tests?— Ajay Sharma The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main is a highly competitive entrance test that opens the door to some of India’s finest engineering colleges. Mock tests are an essential part of the preparation process for the aspiring engineers who invest years of time and energy into successfully passing this test. We’ll go into the importance of mock exams in this blog and when it’s best to include them in your JEE Main preparation plan. Mock tests are like practice runs for the real deal, offering students a chance to gauge their strengths and weaknesses, fine-tune their time management skills, and get comfortable with the exam format and atmosphere. They can also help boost confidence, minimize exam stress, and sharpen problem-solving abilities. It’s clear that including mock tests in your study schedule is crucial for thorough preparation. Early phase of preparation: The journey to cracking JEE Main is a marathon, not a sprint. Beginning your mock test early in your preparation phase can provide you with important insights into your current level of understanding and identify areas that require more attention. Starting with mock tests in the early phase helps in preparing a base and understanding the exam pattern, making it easier to create a targeted study plan. As a rule of thumb, initiating mock tests about 3 to 4 months before the actual examination can be beneficial. For example, in 2024, the first phase of JEE Main is scheduled in January, so the early phase for the same was around September to October. So those students who have already done this part or planning to do it now, have completed their early phase of preparation. This allows ample time for both self-study and targeted improvement based on your performance in the mock tests. Mid-preparation phase: The mid-phase of your JEE Main preparation gets increasingly important as you move forward because it’s when you may sharpen your abilities and adjust your strategies. By this point, you should have covered a significant portion of the syllabus. Incorporating mock tests into your routine during this stage helps you assess your progress, identify weak areas, and focus on refining your time management skills. Around 2 to 3 months before the examination, consider taking full-length mock tests on a regular basis. This not only helps in building stamina for the lengthy exam but also provides a realistic preview of the actual test conditions. Analysing your performance in these mock tests will enable you to prioritize topics and allocate your study time more efficiently.

              "       '‘Pressure’ from parents behind student suicides, says Supreme Court“Intense competition” and “pressure” of parents on their wards preparing for competitive exams are the main reasons for the rising number of suicides across the country, the Supreme Court said on Monday. Hearing a plea that sought regulation of the mushrooming coaching institutes and cited the data on student suicides, a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti, however, expressed helplessness and said the judiciary cannot pass directions in such a scenario. “These are not easy things. Pressure from parents is behind all these incidents. More than the children, it is the parents who are putting pressure on them. How can the court pass directions in such a scenario,” the bench told advocate Mohini Priya, appearing for the petitioner –Mumbai-based doctor Aniruddha Narayan Malpani. Justice Khanna said, “Although, most of us will not want any coaching institute to be there, but look at the conditions of schools. There is intense competition and students have no other option but to go to these coaching institutes.” Referring to the 2020 data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Priya said it highlights that around 8.2 per cent of students in the country die by suicide. The bench said that it knows about the situation but the court can’t pass directions and suggested that the petitioner instead approach the government with his suggestions. Priya sought to withdraw the plea to approach the appropriate forum, which the court allowed. The plea filed by Malpani through Priya said that it seeks appropriate directions for regulating the conduct of “profit-hungry private coaching institutes mushrooming across India which provide coaching for various competitive entrance examinations such as IIT-JEE (Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination) and NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)”. It said that the petitioner has been constrained to approach the court as several students have died by suicide in recent years “facilitated by the absolute lack of regulation and oversight by the Respondents (Centre and state governments)”. “Children as young as 14 years enter these coaching factories often away from their homes and undergo rigorous preparation in the anticipation of getting admission to a good medical or engineering college. “After being in a protected home environment, the child is suddenly exposed to the harsh competitive world without being mentally equipped to do so. These profit-hungry coaching institutes, however, do not care about student well-being and are only focussed on minting money leading to the youth of India being pressurised enough to take their own lives,” the petition said. It said that children are being made to live and study in these coaching factories in subpar and abnormal conditions which are severely affecting their mental health. “What is most dangerous about mental health is that it is invisible, unlike other ailments in our body. However, just like other physical ailments, mental health problems too are triggered by extrinsic forces, surrounding environment and pressures,” it said. The plea said that student suicides were a grave human rights concern. “The lackadaisical attitude of the Centre in enacting a law despite the rising number of suicides clearly reflects upon the State’s apathy towards protecting these young minds who are the future of our country and their constitutional right to live with dignity guaranteed under Article 21,” the plea alleged.',\n",

              "       'Bags packed with books & dreams, 780 girls board train from Jammu for nationwide study tourJammu and Kashmir’s new College on Wheels rolled out of Katra railway station on Sunday with its first batch of 780 girls — all college students from different parts of the Union Territory. For many of them, it was their first train journey, and their first time venturing out of J&K. Travelling on a special train named JK Gyanodaya Express, they reached their first stop –Delhi– on Monday. Over the next two weeks, the train will further take them to various other parts of the country, includingAhmedabad,Mumbai, and Bengaluru, with the aim of imparting hands-on knowledge about the cultural wealth and heritage of India. College on Wheels is an initiative of the J&K Higher Education Council, and is being spearheaded byJammuUniversity, said JU Vice-Chancellor Umesh Rai. The students will do projects related to different subjects while on their travels. This, Rai said, would “dissolve the boundaries” of their subject of study, and also dissolve the four walls of classrooms that keep students constrained inside. Flagging off the train at Katra on Sunday, J&K Lieutenant GovernorManoj Sinhasaid the initiative would open a new chapter in the education sector of the Union Territory. Among hundreds of excited students thronging the platform to board the College on Wheels at Katra railway station was Sofia Hafeez, an undergraduate student from the Government Degree College in Kashmir’s Beerwah. “It is my first time travelling outside J&K, and also my first train journey,” she said, adding that she was excited at the opportunity to meet and interact with people from other states. Like Sofia, Sumaira Zubeen also expressed her excitement at the prospect of visiting places outside the UT. A postgraduate student of Islamic Studies at Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University in Rajouri, she said she was looking forward to “observing the lives, culture, food habits and attire” of people from different parts of the country. The students on the train were chosen on the basis of their project proposals, said the JU V-C. In July, students were asked to submit project proposals in their colleges, out of which the shortlisted ones were chosen to be a part of the College of Wheels. A group of seven-eight students from multiple disciplines of study work together on one project, Rai said. Each student group will be headed by a mentor. The projects the student groups are working on include those titled ‘From Bharat, Beyond Earth’, ‘A New Thought On An Old Subject’, ‘A Friend Who Taught Me A Language On The Train’, and even ‘Shopping On Wheels’. Teams of doctors and paramedical staff of the IRTC, the UT administration and JU, as well as personnel of the J&K Police and the RPF will accompany the students. There is a library on the train, and the students are encouraged to read at least one book during the journey. They will have access to laptops to work on their projects, and will also give presentations during the journey, Rai said. When the train arrived at the Safdarjung railway station in Delhi on Monday, 22-year-old Shivani Sharma stepped out onto the platform feeling both nervous and excited. She had never travelled outside of J&K before. “This is only the second time I have sat inside a train in my whole life. I was very young the first time around, so I don’t remember much of that experience. This project is the first time I got an opportunity to get out of J&K,” said Shivani, who is doing a postgraduate course in JU. Her team is working on a project on the ‘Food Culture’ in different parts of India. “We have prepared questionnaires for people… In each state we visit, we will interact with people in those states and find out about what they like to eat the most, where they like to eat, and so on,” she said. Like Shivani, 22-year-old Pawandeep Kaur is also visiting the national capital for the first time. “This is going to be a new learning experience, and I am excited to visit the Rashtrapathi Bhawan and the Parliament House,” she said. Explaining her project on PCOS and breastcancerawareness, the JU student said: “We have prepared questionnaires regarding PCOS and breast cancer issues amongst women, and we will approach local girls in each state that we are going to visit. By the end of this journey, we aim to educate women on how they can take care of their lifestyle and health. We are hoping to put together a report that we aim to publish.” In Delhi, the students will visit both the old and new buildings of Parliament, as well as the Rashtrapati Bhawan. They will then proceed to Ahmedabad, where they will visit the Sabarmati Ashram. In Mumbai, they will visit the Naval Dockyard, IIT-Mumbai and the Gateway of India. Then inGoa, they will visit the Hansa Naval Air Station, and in Bengaluru, they will visit the Indian Institute of Science and Technology, andISRO. They will also go to Wadhra, where they will visit the Paunar Ashram and other sightseeing spots. They will then return to Delhi and finally to Jammu on December 2. The J&K administration is spending around 4.75 crore on the initiative. Vice-chairman of the J&K Higher Education Council and former V-C of Delhi University, Dinesh Singh, said train journeys had inspired Mahatma Gandhi, and hoped that this journey would do the same for these students. “This entire journey is for these young women to inspire themselves with Gandhi’s philosophy, and to discover themselves on this train like Gandhi did. Education is not just bound to a classroom with a blackboard. It is so much more than that,” he said. “There will be two charkhas on board and there will be a competition, the girls who spin the charkhas the fastest will be rewarded with a book,” he said.',\n",
              "       'IIT-Madras launches information platform on accelerators, incubatorsThe Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras’ Centre for Research on Start-ups and Risk Financing (CREST) has developed the country’s first information platform on incubators and accelerators. The platform is developed in partnership with YNOS, an IIT Madras-incubated start-up. The information platform will contain comprehensive information on incubators and accelerators, which seeks to play an important role in helping start-ups navigate an uncertain entrepreneurial ecosystem. India had about 1,000 active incubators, but until now, the information about them was scattered and not easily available in a single location, an IIT Madras statement said. Entrepreneurs, the institute said, had to spend a lot of time and effort to identify the incubator most suitable for their start-up. The platform would address this pain point and help the start-up founders to identify, compare and analyse incubators very easily and would shortlist one that best fits their requirements. The incubator platform has been developed using the latest technology tools to quickly analyse the incubator and accelerator landscape in India. It features intuitive filters on multiple incubator parameters to quickly identify the set of incubators that satisfy different criteria for shortlisting and a facility to bookmark shortlisted incubators for detailed assessment at a later stage.',\n",
              "       'Toppers’ Tips: ‘I started CUET UG preparation after my board exams’Dishank Gandhi took the CUET in its debut edition in 2022. He appeared for four papers – history, political science, English and psychology and topped the Common University Entrance Test UG with 800/800 marks. He scored an overall pass percentage of 92 per cent in Class 10 and 94.8 per cent in Class 12. Currently pursuing BA (Hons) History from St Stephen’s College atDelhiUniversity, the topper shares how he prepared for theCUET. I relied on self-study. Although I mainly focussed on NCERT books for CUET UG preparation, I did not keep my preparation strategy restricted. I delved deeper into concepts and topics. I used the internet to garner more knowledge on the topics in addition to the NCERTs. I started my CUET preparation after my board exams were over. The only additional thing that I felt would require attention was the CBSE deleted portions. I did not want to complicate my board exams by including CUET preparation. The entrance test was not difficult as almost all the questions were directly related to the NCERT books. However, I was heavily impacted by the mismanagement of CUET. After coming out from my exam centre, I came to know that the paper got cancelled as many were unable to complete their biometric attendance. On the next day, I was affected by Covid. On the revised test date, I was ill and weak. I chose St Stephen’s because it is one of the best colleges in India as per many rankings. St Stephen’s was my first preference. I also added some programmes of Hindu College as my preferences. – Focus on the board exams first – Do not complicate the board preparation by including CUET UG preparation pressure – Try to be consistent with the preparation – Focus on accumulating knowledge, rather than an exam The highly renowned faculty goes out of their traditional roles as teachers to help the students in every way they can, whether it is about studies, their future prospects or anything else. After getting admission to St Stephen’s College, I am realising that the colleges do not matter as much as the programme. Internship and direct placement scopes are very low for a history student like me. So I have enrolled in several skill-enhancement courses like IT, coding, Java, SQL and Python programming languages. I was inclined to information technology, computer science however as I did not have maths, I was unable to take science after Class 12. I now have developed an interest in law. I might take law after my graduation.',\n",
